<h2>Cousin Betty</h2>

<h3>by Honore de Balzac</h3>

<h4><br>
 Translated by James Waring</h4>

<h4><br>
 DEDICATION</h4>

<p>To Don Michele Angelo Cajetani, Prince of Teano.</p>

<p>It is neither to the Roman Prince, nor to the representative
of<br>
 the illustrious house of Cajetani, which has given more than
one<br>
 Pope to the Christian Church, that I dedicate this short
portion<br>
 of a long history; it is to the learned commentator of
Dante.</p>

<p>It was you who led me to understand the marvelous framework
of<br>
 ideas on which the great Italian poet built his poem, the
only<br>
 work which the moderns can place by that of Homer. Till I
heard<br>
 you, the Divine Comedy was to me a vast enigma to which none
had<br>
 found the clue--the commentators least of all. Thus, to
understand<br>
 Dante is to be as great as he; but every form of greatness
is<br>
 familiar to you.</p>

<p><br>
 A French savant could make a reputation, earn a professor's
chair,<br>
 and a dozen decorations, by publishing in a dogmatic volume
the<br>
 improvised lecture by which you lent enchantment to one of
those<br>
 evenings which are rest after seeing Rome. You do not know,<br>
 perhaps, that most of our professors live on Germany, on
England,<br>
 on the East, or on the North, as an insect lives on a tree;
and,<br>
 like the insect, become an integral part of it, borrowing
their<br>
 merit from that of what they feed on. Now, Italy hitherto has
not<br>
 yet been worked out in public lectures. No one will ever give
me<br>
 credit for my literary honesty. Merely by plundering you I
might<br>
 have been as learned as three Schlegels in one, whereas I mean
to<br>
 remain a humble Doctor of the Faculty of Social Medicine, a<br>
 veterinary surgeon for incurable maladies. Were it only to lay
a<br>
 token of gratitude at the feet of my cicerone, I would fain
add<br>
 your illustrious name to those of Porcia, of San-Severino,
of<br>
 Pareto, of di Negro, and of Belgiojoso, who will represent in
this<br>
 "Human Comedy" the close and constant alliance between Italy
and<br>
 France, to which Bandello did honor in the same way in the<br>
 sixteenth century--Bandello, the bishop and author of some
strange<br>
 tales indeed, who left us the splendid collection of
romances<br>
 whence Shakespeare derived many of his plots and even
complete<br>
 characters, word for word.</p>

<p>The two sketches I dedicate to you are the two eternal aspects
of<br>
 one and the same fact. Homo duplex, said the great Buffon: why
not<br>
 add Res duplex? Everything has two sides, even virtue. Hence<br>
 Moliere always shows us both sides of every human problem;
and<br>
 Diderot, imitating him, once wrote, "This is not a mere
tale"--in<br>
 what is perhaps Diderot's masterpiece, where he shows us the<br>
 beautiful picture of Mademoiselle de Lachaux sacrificed by<br>
 Gardanne, side by side with that of a perfect lover dying for
his<br>
 mistress.</p>

<p>In the same way, these two romances form a pair, like twins
of<br>
 opposite sexes. This is a literary vagary to which a writer
may<br>
 for once give way, especially as part of a work in which I
am<br>
 endeavoring to depict every form that can serve as a garb to
mind.</p>

<p>Most human quarrels arise from the fact that both wise men
and<br>
 dunces exist who are so constituted as to be incapable of
seeing<br>
 more than one side of any fact or idea, while each asserts
that<br>
 the side he sees is the only true and right one. Thus it is<br>
 written in the Holy Book, "God will deliver the world over
to<br>
 divisions." I must confess that this passage of Scripture
alone<br>
 should persuade the Papal See to give you the control of the
two<br>
 Chambers to carry out the text which found its commentary in
1814,<br>
 in the decree of Louis XVIII.</p>

<p>May your wit and the poetry that is in you extend a
protecting<br>
 hand over these two histories of "The Poor Relations"</p>

<p>Of your affectionate humble servant,</p>

<p>DE BALZAC.<br>
 PARIS, August-September, 1846.</p>

<h1>COUSIN BETTY</h1>

<h2>PART I</h2>

<h3>THE PRODIGAL FATHER</h3>

<p>One day, about the middle of July 1838, one of the carriages,
then<br>
 lately introduced to Paris cabstands, and known as
<i>Milords</i>, was<br>
 driving down the Rue de l'Universite, conveying a stout man of
middle<br>
 height in the uniform of a captain of the National Guard.</p>

<p>Among the Paris crowd, who are supposed to be so clever, there
are<br>
 some men who fancy themselves infinitely more attractive in
uniform<br>
 than in their ordinary clothes, and who attribute to women so
depraved<br>
 a taste that they believe they will be favorably impressed by
the<br>
 aspect of a busby and of military accoutrements.</p>

<p><br>
 The countenance of this Captain of the Second Company beamed
with a<br>
 self-satisfaction that added splendor to his ruddy and somewhat
chubby<br>
 face. The halo of glory that a fortune made in business gives to
a<br>
 retired tradesman sat on his brow, and stamped him as one of the
elect<br>
 of Paris--at least a retired deputy-mayor of his quarter of the
town.<br>
 And you may be sure that the ribbon of the Legion of Honor was
not<br>
 missing from his breast, gallantly padded <i>a la
Prussienne</i>. Proudly<br>
 seated in one corner of the <i>milord</i>, this splendid person
let his<br>
 gaze wander over the passers-by, who, in Paris, often thus meet
an<br>
 ingratiating smile meant for sweet eyes that are absent.</p>

<p>The vehicle stopped in the part of the street between the Rue
de<br>
 Bellechasse and the Rue de Bourgogne, at the door of a large,
newly-<br>
 build house, standing on part of the court-yard of an ancient
mansion<br>
 that had a garden. The old house remained in its original
state,<br>
 beyond the courtyard curtailed by half its extent.</p>

<p>Only from the way in which the officer accepted the assistance
of the<br>
 coachman to help him out, it was plain that he was past fifty.
There<br>
 are certain movements so undisguisedly heavy that they are as
tell-<br>
 tale as a register of birth. The captain put on his
lemon-colored<br>
 right-hand glove, and, without any question to the gatekeeper,
went up<br>
 the outer steps to the ground of the new house with a look
that<br>
 proclaimed, "She is mine!"</p>

<p>The <i>concierges</i> of Paris have sharp eyes; they do not
stop visitors<br>
 who wear an order, have a blue uniform, and walk ponderously;
in<br>
 short, they know a rich man when they see him.</p>

<p>This ground floor was entirely occupied by Monsieur le Baron
Hulot<br>
 d'Ervy, Commissary General under the Republic, retired army<br>
 contractor, and at the present time at the head of one of the
most<br>
 important departments of the War Office, Councillor of State,
officer<br>
 of the Legion of Honor, and so forth.</p>

<p>This Baron Hulot had taken the name of d'Ervy--the place of
his birth<br>
 --to distinguish him from his brother, the famous General
Hulot,<br>
 Colonel of the Grenadiers of the Imperial Guard, created by
the<br>
 Emperor Comte de Forzheim after the campaign of 1809. The Count,
the<br>
 elder brother, being responsible for his junior, had, with
paternal<br>
 care, placed him in the commissariat, where, thanks to the
services of<br>
 the two brothers, the Baron deserved and won Napoleon's good
graces.<br>
 After 1807, Baron Hulot was Commissary General for the army in
Spain.</p>

<p>Having rung the bell, the citizen-captain made strenuous
efforts to<br>
 pull his coat into place, for it had rucked up as much at the
back as<br>
 in front, pushed out of shape by the working of a piriform
stomach.<br>
 Being admitted as soon as the servant in livery saw him, the
important<br>
 and imposing personage followed the man, who opened the door of
the<br>
 drawing-room, announcing:</p>

<p>"Monsieur Crevel."</p>

<p>On hearing the name, singularly appropriate to the figure of
the man<br>
 who bore it, a tall, fair woman, evidently young-looking for her
age,<br>
 rose as if she had received an electric shock.</p>

<p>"Hortense, my darling, go into the garden with your Cousin
Betty," she<br>
 said hastily to her daughter, who was working at some embroidery
at<br>
 her mother's side.</p>

<p>After curtseying prettily to the captain, Mademoiselle
Hortense went<br>
 out by a glass door, taking with her a withered-looking
spinster, who<br>
 looked older than the Baroness, though she was five years
younger.</p>

<p>"They are settling your marriage," said Cousin Betty in the
girl's<br>
 ear, without seeming at all offended at the way in which the
Baroness<br>
 had dismissed them, counting her almost as zero.</p>

<p>The cousin's dress might, at need, have explained this
free-and-easy<br>
 demeanor. The old maid wore a merino gown of a dark plum color,
of<br>
 which the cut and trimming dated from the year of the
Restoration; a<br>
 little worked collar, worth perhaps three francs; and a common
straw<br>
 hat with blue satin ribbons edged with straw plait, such as the
old-<br>
 clothes buyers wear at market. On looking down at her kid shoes,
made,<br>
 it was evident, by the veriest cobbler, a stranger would
have<br>
 hesitated to recognize Cousin Betty as a member of the family,
for she<br>
 looked exactly like a journeywoman sempstress. But she did not
leave<br>
 the room without bestowing a little friendly nod on Monsieur
Crevel,<br>
 to which that gentleman responded by a look of mutual
understanding.</p>

<p>"You are coming to us to-morrow, I hope, Mademoiselle
Fischer?" said<br>
 he.</p>

<p>"You have no company?" asked Cousin Betty.</p>

<p>"My children and yourself, no one else," replied the
visitor.</p>

<p>"Very well," replied she; "depend on me."</p>

<p>"And here am I, madame, at your orders," said the
citizen-captain,<br>
 bowing again to Madame Hulot.</p>

<p>He gave such a look at Madame Hulot as Tartuffe casts at
Elmire--when<br>
 a provincial actor plays the part and thinks it necessary to
emphasize<br>
 its meaning--at Poitiers, or at Coutances.</p>

<p>"If you will come into this room with me, we shall be more<br>
 conveniently placed for talking business than we are in this
room,"<br>
 said Madame Hulot, going to an adjoining room, which, as the
apartment<br>
 was arranged, served as a cardroom.</p>

<p>It was divided by a slight partition from a boudoir looking
out on the<br>
 garden, and Madame Hulot left her visitor to himself for a
minute, for<br>
 she thought it wise to shut the window and the door of the
boudoir, so<br>
 that no one should get in and listen. She even took the
precaution of<br>
 shutting the glass door of the drawing-room, smiling on her
daughter<br>
 and her cousin, whom she saw seated in an old summer-house at
the end<br>
 of the garden. As she came back she left the cardroom door open,
so as<br>
 to hear if any one should open that of the drawing-room to come
in.</p>

<p>As she came and went, the Baroness, seen by nobody, allowed
her face<br>
 to betray all her thoughts, and any one who could have seen her
would<br>
 have been shocked to see her agitation. But when she finally
came back<br>
 from the glass door of the drawing-room, as she entered the
cardroom,<br>
 her face was hidden behind the impenetrable reserve which every
woman,<br>
 even the most candid, seems to have at her command.</p>

<p>During all these preparations--odd, to say the least--the
National<br>
 Guardsman studied the furniture of the room in which he found
himself.<br>
 As he noted the silk curtains, once red, now faded to dull
purple by<br>
 the sunshine, and frayed in the pleats by long wear; the carpet,
from<br>
 which the hues had faded; the discolored gilding of the
furniture; and<br>
 the silk seats, discolored in patches, and wearing into
strips--<br>
 expressions of scorn, satisfaction, and hope dawned in
succession<br>
 without disguise on his stupid tradesman's face. He looked at
himself<br>
 in the glass over an old clock of the Empire, and was
contemplating<br>
 the general effect, when the rustle of her silk skirt announced
the<br>
 Baroness. He at once struck at attitude.</p>

<p>After dropping on to a sofa, which had been a very handsome
one in the<br>
 year 1809, the Baroness, pointing to an armchair with the arms
ending<br>
 in bronze sphinxes' heads, while the paint was peeling from the
wood,<br>
 which showed through in many places, signed to Crevel to be
seated.</p>

<p>"All the precautions you are taking, madame, would seem full
of<br>
 promise to a----"</p>

<p>"To a lover," said she, interrupting him.</p>

<p>"The word is too feeble," said he, placing his right hand on
his<br>
 heart, and rolling his eyes in a way which almost always makes a
woman<br>
 laugh when she, in cold blood, sees such a look. "A lover! A
lover?<br>
 Say a man bewitched----"</p>

<p>"Listen, Monsieur Crevel," said the Baroness, too anxious to
be able<br>
 to laugh, "you are fifty--ten years younger than Monsieur Hulot,
I<br>
 know; but at my age a woman's follies ought to be justified by
beauty,<br>
 youth, fame, superior merit--some one of the splendid qualities
which<br>
 can dazzle us to the point of making us forget all else--even at
our<br>
 age. Though you may have fifty thousand francs a year, your
age<br>
 counterbalances your fortune; thus you have nothing whatever of
what a<br>
 woman looks for----"</p>

<p>"But love!" said the officer, rising and coming forward. "Such
love<br>
 as----"</p>

<p>"No, monsieur, such obstinacy!" said the Baroness,
interrupting him to<br>
 put an end to his absurdity.</p>

<p>"Yes, obstinacy," said he, "and love; but something stronger
still--a<br>
 claim----"</p>

<p>"A claim!" cried Madame Hulot, rising sublime with scorn,
defiance,<br>
 and indignation. "But," she went on, "this will bring us to no
issues;<br>
 I did not ask you to come here to discuss the matter which led
to your<br>
 banishment in spite of the connection between our
families----"</p>

<p>"I had fancied so."</p>

<p>"What! still?" cried she. "Do you not see, monsieur, by the
entire<br>
 ease and freedom with which I can speak of lovers and love,
of<br>
 everything least creditable to a woman, that I am perfectly
secure in<br>
 my own virtue? I fear nothing--not even to shut myself in alone
with<br>
 you. Is that the conduct of a weak woman? You know full well why
I<br>
 begged you to come."</p>

<p>"No, madame," replied Crevel, with an assumption of great
coldness. He<br>
 pursed up his lips, and again struck an attitude.</p>

<p>"Well, I will be brief, to shorten our common discomfort,"
said the<br>
 Baroness, looking at Crevel.</p>

<p>Crevel made an ironical bow, in which a man who knew the race
would<br>
 have recognized the graces of a bagman.</p>

<p>"Our son married your daughter----"</p>

<p>"And if it were to do again----" said Crevel.</p>

<p>"It would not be done at all, I suspect," said the baroness
hastily.<br>
 "However, you have nothing to complain of. My son is not only
one of<br>
 the leading pleaders of Paris, but for the last year he has sat
as<br>
 Deputy, and his maiden speech was brilliant enough to lead us
to<br>
 suppose that ere long he will be in office. Victorin has twice
been<br>
 called upon to report on important measures; and he might even
now, if<br>
 he chose, be made Attorney-General in the Court of Appeal. So,
if you<br>
 mean to say that your son-in-law has no fortune----"</p>

<p>"Worse than that, madame, a son-in-law whom I am obliged to
maintain,"<br>
 replied Crevel. "Of the five hundred thousand francs that formed
my<br>
 daughter's marriage portion, two hundred thousand have
vanished--God<br>
 knows how!--in paying the young gentleman's debts, in furnishing
his<br>
 house splendaciously--a house costing five hundred thousand
francs,<br>
 and bringing in scarcely fifteen thousand, since he occupies
the<br>
 larger part of it, while he owes two hundred and sixty thousand
francs<br>
 of the purchase-money. The rent he gets barely pays the interest
on<br>
 the debt. I have had to give my daughter twenty thousand francs
this<br>
 year to help her to make both ends meet. And then my son-in-law,
who<br>
 was making thirty thousand francs a year at the Assizes, I am
told, is<br>
 going to throw that up for the Chamber----"</p>

<p>"This, again, Monsieur Crevel, is beside the mark; we are
wandering<br>
 from the point. Still, to dispose of it finally, it may be said
that<br>
 if my son gets into office, if he has you made an officer of
the<br>
 Legion of Honor and councillor of the municipality of Paris,
you, as a<br>
 retired perfumer, will not have much to complain of----"</p>

<p>"Ah! there we are again, madame! Yes, I am a tradesman, a
shopkeeper,<br>
 a retail dealer in almond-paste, eau-de-Portugal, and hair-oil,
and<br>
 was only too much honored when my only daughter was married to
the son<br>
 of Monsieur le Baron Hulot d'Ervy--my daughter will be a
Baroness!<br>
 This is Regency, Louis XV., (Eil-de-boeuf--quite tip-top!--very
good.)<br>
 I love Celestine as a man loves his only child--so well indeed,
that,<br>
 to preserve her from having either brother or sister, I
resigned<br>
 myself to all the privations of a widower--in Paris, and in the
prime<br>
 of life, madame. But you must understand that, in spite of
this<br>
 extravagant affection for my daughter, I do not intend to reduce
my<br>
 fortune for the sake of your son, whose expenses are not
wholly<br>
 accounted for--in my eyes, as an old man of business."</p>

<p><br>
 "Monsieur, you may at this day see in the Ministry of
Commerce<br>
 Monsieur Popinot, formerly a druggist in the Rue des
Lombards----"</p>

<p>"And a friend of mine, madame," said the ex-perfumer. "For I,
Celestin<br>
 Crevel, foreman once to old Cesar Birotteau, brought up the said
Cesar<br>
 Birotteau's stock; and he was Popinot's father-in-law. Why, that
very<br>
 Popinot was no more than a shopman in the establishment, and he
is the<br>
 first to remind me of it; for he is not proud, to do him
justice, to<br>
 men in a good position with an income of sixty thousand francs
in the<br>
 funds."</p>

<p>"Well then, monsieur, the notions you term 'Regency' are quite
out of<br>
 date at a time when a man is taken at his personal worth; and
that is<br>
 what you did when you married your daughter to my son."</p>

<p>"But you do not know how the marriage was brought about!"
cried<br>
 Crevel. "Oh, that cursed bachelor life! But for my misconduct,
my<br>
 Celestine might at this day be Vicomtesse Popinot!"</p>

<p>"Once more have done with recriminations over accomplished
facts,"<br>
 said the Baroness anxiously. "Let us rather discuss the
complaints I<br>
 have found on your strange behavior. My daughter Hortense had a
chance<br>
 of marrying; the match depended entirely on you; I believed you
felt<br>
 some sentiments of generosity; I thought you would do justice to
a<br>
 woman who has never had a thought in her heart for any man but
her<br>
 husband, that you would have understood how necessary it is for
her<br>
 not to receive a man who may compromise her, and that for the
honor of<br>
 the family with which you are allied you would have been eager
to<br>
 promote Hortense's settlement with Monsieur le Conseiller
Lebas.--And<br>
 it is you, monsieur, you have hindered the marriage."</p>

<p>"Madame," said the ex-perfumer, "I acted the part of an honest
man. I<br>
 was asked whether the two hundred thousand francs to be settled
on<br>
 Mademoiselle Hortense would be forthcoming. I replied exactly in
these<br>
 words: 'I would not answer for it. My son-in-law, to whom the
Hulots<br>
 had promised the same sum, was in debt; and I believe that if
Monsieur<br>
 Hulot d'Ervy were to die to-morrow, his widow would have nothing
to<br>
 live on.'--There, fair lady."</p>

<p>"And would you have said as much, monsieur," asked Madame
Hulot,<br>
 looking Crevel steadily in the face, "if I had been false to my
duty?"</p>

<p>"I should not be in a position to say it, dearest Adeline,"
cried this<br>
 singular adorer, interrupting the Baroness, "for you would have
found<br>
 the amount in my pocket-book."</p>

<p>And adding action to word, the fat guardsman knelt down on one
knee<br>
 and kissed Madame Hulot's hand, seeing that his speech had
filled her<br>
 with speechless horror, which he took for hesitancy.</p>

<p>"What, buy my daughter's fortune at the cost of----? Rise,
monsieur--<br>
 or I ring the bell."</p>

<p>Crevel rose with great difficulty. This fact made him so
furious that<br>
 he again struck his favorite attitude. Most men have some
habitual<br>
 position by which they fancy that they show to the best
advantage the<br>
 good points bestowed on them by nature. This attitude in
Crevel<br>
 consisted in crossing his arms like Napoleon, his head showing
three-<br>
 quarters face, and his eyes fixed on the horizon, as the painter
has<br>
 shown the Emperor in his portrait.</p>

<p>"To be faithful," he began, with well-acted indignation, "so
faithful<br>
 to a liber----"</p>

<p>"To a husband who is worthy of such fidelity," Madame Hulot
put in, to<br>
 hinder Crevel from saying a word she did not choose to hear.</p>

<p>"Come, madame; you wrote to bid me here, you ask the reasons
for my<br>
 conduct, you drive me to extremities with your imperial airs,
your<br>
 scorn, and your contempt! Any one might think I was a Negro. But
I<br>
 repeat it, and you may believe me, I have a right to--to make
love to<br>
 you, for---- But no; I love you well enough to hold my
tongue."</p>

<p>"You may speak, monsieur. In a few days I shall be
eight-and-forty; I<br>
 am no prude; I can hear whatever you can say."</p>

<p>"Then will you give me your word of honor as an honest
woman--for you<br>
 are, alas for me! an honest woman--never to mention my name or
to say<br>
 that it was I who betrayed the secret?"</p>

<p>"If that is the condition on which you speak, I will swear
never to<br>
 tell any one from whom I heard the horrors you propose to tell
me, not<br>
 even my husband."</p>

<p>"I should think not indeed, for only you and he are
concerned."</p>

<p>Madame Hulot turned pale.</p>

<p>"Oh, if you still really love Hulot, it will distress you.
Shall I say<br>
 no more?"</p>

<p>"Speak, monsieur; for by your account you wish to justify in
my eyes<br>
 the extraordinary declarations you have chosen to make me, and
your<br>
 persistency in tormenting a woman of my age, whose only wish is
to see<br>
 her daughter married, and then--to die in peace----"</p>

<p>"You see; you are unhappy."</p>

<p>"I, monsieur?"</p>

<p>"Yes, beautiful, noble creature!" cried Crevel. "You have
indeed been<br>
 too wretched!"</p>

<p>"Monsieur, be silent and go--or speak to me as you ought."</p>

<p>"Do you know, madame, how Master Hulot and I first made
acquaintance?<br>
 --At our mistresses', madame."</p>

<p>"Oh, monsieur!"</p>

<p>"Yes, madame, at our mistresses'," Crevel repeated in a
melodramatic<br>
 tone, and leaving his position to wave his right hand.</p>

<p>"Well, and what then?" said the Baroness coolly, to Crevel's
great<br>
 amazement.</p>

<p>Such mean seducers cannot understand a great soul.</p>

<p>"I, a widower five years since," Crevel began, in the tone of
a man<br>
 who has a story to tell, "and not wishing to marry again for the
sake<br>
 of the daughter I adore, not choosing either to cultivate any
such<br>
 connection in my own establishment, though I had at the time a
very<br>
 pretty lady-accountant. I set up, 'on her own account,' as they
say, a<br>
 little sempstress of fifteen--really a miracle of beauty, with
whom I<br>
 fell desperately in love. And in fact, madame, I asked an aunt
of my<br>
 own, my mother's sister, whom I sent for from the country, to
live<br>
 with the sweet creature and keep an eye on her, that she might
behave<br>
 as well as might be in this rather--what shall I
say--shady?--no,<br>
 delicate position.</p>

<p>"The child, whose talent for music was striking, had masters,
she was<br>
 educated--I had to give her something to do. Besides, I wished
to be<br>
 at once her father, her benefactor, and--well, out with it--her
lover;<br>
 to kill two birds with one stone, a good action and a
sweetheart. For<br>
 five years I was very happy. The girl had one of those voices
that<br>
 make the fortune of a theatre; I can only describe her by saying
that<br>
 she is a Duprez in petticoats. It cost me two thousand francs a
year<br>
 only to cultivate her talent as a singer. She made me music-mad;
I<br>
 took a box at the opera for her and for my daughter, and went
there<br>
 alternate evenings with Celestine or Josepha."</p>

<p>"What, the famous singer?"</p>

<p>"Yes, madame," said Crevel with pride, "the famous Josepha
owes<br>
 everything to me.--At last, in 1834, when the child was
twenty,<br>
 believing that I had attached her to me for ever, and being very
weak<br>
 where she was concerned, I thought I would give her a little<br>
 amusement, and I introduced her to a pretty little actress,
Jenny<br>
 Cadine, whose life had been somewhat like her own. This actress
also<br>
 owed everything to a protector who had brought her up in
leading-<br>
 strings. That protector was Baron Hulot."</p>

<p>"I know that," said the Baroness, in a calm voice without the
least<br>
 agitation.</p>

<p>"Bless me!" cried Crevel, more and more astounded. "Well! But
do you<br>
 know that your monster of a husband took Jenny Cadine in hand at
the<br>
 age of thirteen?"</p>

<p>"What then?" said the Baroness.</p>

<p>"As Jenny Cadine and Josepha were both aged twenty when they
first<br>
 met," the ex-tradesman went on, "the Baron had been playing the
part<br>
 of Louis XV. to Mademoiselle de Romans ever since 1826, and you
were<br>
 twelve years younger then----"</p>

<p>"I had my reasons, monsieur, for leaving Monsieur Hulot his
liberty."</p>

<p>"That falsehood, madame, will surely be enough to wipe out
every sin<br>
 you have ever committed, and to open to you the gates of
Paradise,"<br>
 replied Crevel, with a knowing air that brought the color to
the<br>
 Baroness' cheeks. "Sublime and adored woman, tell that to those
who<br>
 will believe it, but not to old Crevel, who has, I may tell
you,<br>
 feasted too often as one of four with your rascally husband not
to<br>
 know what your high merits are! Many a time has he blamed
himself when<br>
 half tipsy as he has expatiated on your perfections. Oh, I know
you<br>
 well!--A libertine might hesitate between you and a girl of
twenty. I<br>
 do not hesitate----"</p>

<p>"Monsieur!"</p>

<p>"Well, I say no more. But you must know, saintly and noble
woman, that<br>
 a husband under certain circumstances will tell things about his
wife<br>
 to his mistress that will mightily amuse her."</p>

<p>Tears of shame hanging to Madame Hulot's long lashes checked
the<br>
 National Guardsman. He stopped short, and forgot his
attitude.</p>

<p>"To proceed," said he. "We became intimate, the Baron and I,
through<br>
 the two hussies. The Baron, like all bad lots, is very pleasant,
a<br>
 thoroughly jolly good fellow. Yes, he took my fancy, the old
rascal.<br>
 He could be so funny!--Well, enough of those reminiscences. We
got to<br>
 be like brothers. The scoundrel--quite Regency in his
notions--tried<br>
 indeed to deprave me altogether, preached Saint-Simonism as to
women,<br>
 and all sorts of lordly ideas; but, you see, I was fond enough
of my<br>
 girl to have married her, only I was afraid of having
children.</p>

<p>"Then between two old daddies, such friends as--as we were,
what more<br>
 natural than that we should think of our children marrying each
other?<br>
 --Three months after his son had married my Celestine, Hulot--I
don't<br>
 know how I can utter the wretch's name! he has cheated us both,
madame<br>
 --well, the villain did me out of my little Josepha. The
scoundrel<br>
 knew that he was supplanted in the heart of Jenny Cadine by a
young<br>
 lawyer and by an artist--only two of them!--for the girl had
more and<br>
 more of a howling success, and he stole my sweet little girl,
a<br>
 perfect darling--but you must have seen her at the opera; he got
her<br>
 an engagement there. Your husband is not so well behaved as I
am. I am<br>
 ruled as straight as a sheet of music-paper. He had dropped a
good<br>
 deal of money on Jenny Cadine, who must have cost him near on
thirty<br>
 thousand francs a year. Well, I can only tell you that he is
ruining<br>
 himself outright for Josepha.</p>

<p><br>
 "Josepha, madame, is a Jewess. Her name is Mirah, the anagram
of<br>
 Hiram, an Israelite mark that stamps her, for she was a
foundling<br>
 picked up in Germany, and the inquiries I have made prove that
she is<br>
 the illegitimate child of a rich Jew banker. The life of the
theatre,<br>
 and, above all, the teaching of Jenny Cadine, Madame Schontz,
Malaga,<br>
 and Carabine, as to the way to treat an old man, have developed,
in<br>
 the child whom I had kept in a respectable and not too expensive
way<br>
 of life, all the native Hebrew instinct for gold and jewels--for
the<br>
 golden calf.</p>

<p>"So this famous singer, hungering for plunder, now wants to be
rich,<br>
 very rich. She tried her 'prentice hand on Baron Hulot, and
soon<br>
 plucked him bare--plucked him, ay, and singed him to the skin.
The<br>
 miserable man, after trying to vie with one of the Kellers and
with<br>
 the Marquis d'Esgrignon, both perfectly mad about Josepha, to
say<br>
 nothing of unknown worshipers, is about to see her carried off
by that<br>
 very rich Duke, who is such a patron of the arts. Oh, what is
his<br>
 name?--a dwarf.--Ah, the Duc d'Herouville. This fine gentleman
insists<br>
 on having Josepha for his very own, and all that set are talking
about<br>
 it; the Baron knows nothing of it as yet; for it is the same in
the<br>
 Thirteenth Arrondissement as in every other: the lover, like
the<br>
 husband, is last to get the news.</p>

<p>"Now, do you understand my claim? Your husband, dear lady, has
robbed<br>
 me of my joy in life, the only happiness I have known since I
became a<br>
 widower. Yes, if I had not been so unlucky as to come across
that old<br>
 rip, Josepha would still be mine; for I, you know, should never
have<br>
 placed her on the stage. She would have lived obscure, well
conducted,<br>
 and mine. Oh! if you could but have seen her eight years ago,
slight<br>
 and wiry, with the golden skin of an Andalusian, as they say,
black<br>
 hair as shiny as satin, an eye that flashed lightning under long
brown<br>
 lashes, the style of a duchess in every movement, the modesty of
a<br>
 dependent, decent grace, and the pretty ways of a wild fawn. And
by<br>
 that Hulot's doing all this charm and purity has been degraded
to a<br>
 man-trap, a money-box for five-franc pieces! The girl is the
Queen of<br>
 Trollops; and nowadays she humbugs every one--she who knew
nothing,<br>
 not even that word."</p>

<p>At this stage the retired perfumer wiped his eyes, which were
full of<br>
 tears. The sincerity of his grief touched Madame Hulot, and
roused her<br>
 from the meditation into which she had sunk.</p>

<p>"Tell me, madame, is a man of fifty-two likely to find such
another<br>
 jewel? At my age love costs thirty thousand francs a year. It
is<br>
 through your husband's experience that I know the price, and I
love<br>
 Celestine too truly to be her ruin. When I saw you, at the
first<br>
 evening party you gave in our honor, I wondered how that
scoundrel<br>
 Hulot could keep a Jenny Cadine--you had the manner of an
Empress. You<br>
 do not look thirty," he went on. "To me, madame, you look young,
and<br>
 you are beautiful. On my word of honor, that evening I was
struck to<br>
 the heart. I said to myself, 'If I had not Josepha, since old
Hulot<br>
 neglects his wife, she would fit me like a glove.' Forgive
me--it is a<br>
 reminiscence of my old business. The perfumer will crop up now
and<br>
 then, and that is what keeps me from standing to be elected
deputy.</p>

<p>"And then, when I was so abominably deceived by the Baron, for
really<br>
 between old rips like us our friend's mistress should be sacred,
I<br>
 swore I would have his wife. It is but justice. The Baron could
say<br>
 nothing; we are certain of impunity. You showed me the door like
a<br>
 mangy dog at the first words I uttered as to the state of my
feelings;<br>
 you only made my passion--my obstinacy, if you will--twice as
strong,<br>
 and you shall be mine."</p>

<p>"Indeed; how?"</p>

<p>"I do not know; but it will come to pass. You see, madame, an
idiot of<br>
 a perfumer--retired from business--who has but one idea in his
head,<br>
 is stronger than a clever fellow who has a thousand. I am
smitten with<br>
 you, and you are the means of my revenge; it is like being in
love<br>
 twice over. I am speaking to you quite frankly, as a man who
knows<br>
 what he means. I speak coldly to you, just as you do to me, when
you<br>
 say, 'I never will be yours,' In fact, as they say, I play the
game<br>
 with the cards on the table. Yes, you shall be mine, sooner or
later;<br>
 if you were fifty, you should still be my mistress. And it will
be;<br>
 for I expect anything from your husband!"</p>

<p>Madame Hulot looked at this vulgar intriguer with such a fixed
stare<br>
 of terror, that he thought she had gone mad, and he stopped.</p>

<p>"You insisted on it, you heaped me with scorn, you defied
me--and I<br>
 have spoken," said he, feeling that he must justify the ferocity
of<br>
 his last words.</p>

<p>"Oh, my daughter, my daughter," moaned the Baroness in a voice
like a<br>
 dying woman's.</p>

<p>"Oh! I have forgotten all else," Crevel went on. "The day when
I was<br>
 robbed of Josepha I was like a tigress robbed of her cubs; in
short,<br>
 as you see me now.--Your daughter? Yes, I regard her as the
means of<br>
 winning you. Yes, I put a spoke in her marriage--and you will
not get<br>
 her married without my help! Handsome as Mademoiselle Hortense
is, she<br>
 needs a fortune----"</p>

<p>"Alas! yes," said the Baroness, wiping her eyes.</p>

<p>"Well, just ask your husband for ten thousand francs," said
Crevel,<br>
 striking his attitude once more. He waited a minute, like an
actor who<br>
 has made a point.</p>

<p>"If he had the money, he would give it to the woman who will
take<br>
 Josepha's place," he went on, emphasizing his tones. "Does a man
ever<br>
 pull up on the road he has taken? In the first place, he is too
sweet<br>
 on women. There is a happy medium in all things, as our King has
told<br>
 us. And then his vanity is implicated! He is a handsome man!--He
would<br>
 bring you all to ruin for his pleasure; in fact, you are already
on<br>
 the highroad to the workhouse. Why, look, never since I set foot
in<br>
 your house have you been able to do up your drawing-room
furniture.<br>
 'Hard up' is the word shouted by every slit in the stuff. Where
will<br>
 you find a son-in-law who would not turn his back in horror of
the<br>
 ill-concealed evidence of the most cruel misery there is--that
of<br>
 people in decent society? I have kept shop, and I know. There is
no<br>
 eye so quick as that of the Paris tradesman to detect real
wealth from<br>
 its sham.--You have no money," he said, in a lower voice. "It
is<br>
 written everywhere, even on your man-servant's coat.</p>

<p>"Would you like me to disclose any more hideous mysteries that
are<br>
 kept from you?"</p>

<p>"Monsieur," cried Madame Hulot, whose handkerchief was wet
through<br>
 with her tears, "enough, enough!"</p>

<p>"My son-in-law, I tell you, gives his father money, and this
is what I<br>
 particularly wanted to come to when I began by speaking of your
son's<br>
 expenses. But I keep an eye on my daughter's interests, be
easy."</p>

<p>"Oh, if I could but see my daughter married, and die!" cried
the poor<br>
 woman, quite losing her head.</p>

<p>"Well, then, this is the way," said the ex-perfumer.</p>

<p>Madame Hulot looked at Crevel with a hopeful expression, which
so<br>
 completely changed her countenance, that this alone ought to
have<br>
 touched the man's feelings and have led him to abandon his
monstrous<br>
 schemes.</p>

<p>"You will still be handsome ten years hence," Crevel went on,
with his<br>
 arms folded; "be kind to me, and Mademoiselle Hulot will marry.
Hulot<br>
 has given me the right, as I have explained to you, to put the
matter<br>
 crudely, and he will not be angry. In three years I have saved
the<br>
 interest on my capital, for my dissipations have been
restricted. I<br>
 have three hundred thousand francs in the bank over and above
my<br>
 invested fortune--they are yours----"</p>

<p>"Go," said Madame Hulot. "Go, monsieur, and never let me see
you<br>
 again. But for the necessity in which you placed me to learn
the<br>
 secret of your cowardly conduct with regard to the match I had
planned<br>
 for Hortense--yes, cowardly!" she repeated, in answer to a
gesture<br>
 from Crevel. "How can you load a poor girl, a pretty,
innocent<br>
 creature, with such a weight of enmity? But for the necessity
that<br>
 goaded me as a mother, you would never have spoken to me again,
never<br>
 again have come within my doors. Thirty-two years of an
honorable and<br>
 loyal life shall not be swept away by a blow from Monsieur
Crevel----"</p>

<p>"The retired perfumer, successor to Cesar Birotteau at the
<i>Queen of<br>
 the Roses</i>, Rue Saint-Honore," added Crevel, in mocking
tones.<br>
 "Deputy-mayor, captain in the National Guard, Chevalier of the
Legion<br>
 of Honor--exactly what my predecessor was!"</p>

<p>"Monsieur," said the Baroness, "if, after twenty years of
constancy,<br>
 Monsieur Hulot is tired of his wife, that is nobody's concern
but<br>
 mine. As you see, he has kept his infidelity a mystery, for I
did not<br>
 know that he had succeeded you in the affections of
Mademoiselle<br>
 Josepha----"</p>

<p>"Oh, it has cost him a pretty penny, madame. His singing-bird
has cost<br>
 him more than a hundred thousand francs in these two years. Ah,
ha!<br>
 you have not seen the end of it!"</p>

<p>"Have done with all this, Monsieur Crevel. I will not, for
your sake,<br>
 forego the happiness a mother knows who can embrace her
children<br>
 without a single pang of remorse in her heart, who sees
herself<br>
 respected and loved by her family; and I will give up my soul to
God<br>
 unspotted----"</p>

<p>"Amen!" exclaimed Crevel, with the diabolical rage that
embitters the<br>
 face of these pretenders when they fail for the second time in
such an<br>
 attempt. "You do not yet know the latter end of
poverty--shame,<br>
 disgrace.--I have tried to warn you; I would have saved you, you
and<br>
 your daughter. Well, you must study the modern parable of
the<br>
 <i>Prodigal Father</i> from A to Z. Your tears and your pride
move me<br>
 deeply," said Crevel, seating himself, "for it is frightful to
see the<br>
 woman one loves weeping. All I can promise you, dear Adeline, is
to do<br>
 nothing against your interests or your husband's. Only never
send to<br>
 me for information. That is all."</p>

<p>"What is to be done?" cried Madame Hulot.</p>

<p>Up to now the Baroness had bravely faced the threefold torment
which<br>
 this explanation inflicted on her; for she was wounded as a
woman, as<br>
 a mother, and as a wife. In fact, so long as her son's
father-in-law<br>
 was insolent and offensive, she had found the strength in
her<br>
 resistance to the aggressive tradesman; but the sort of
good-nature he<br>
 showed, in spite of his exasperation as a mortified adorer and
as a<br>
 humiliated National Guardsman, broke down her nerve, strung to
the<br>
 point of snapping. She wrung her hands, melted into tears, and
was in<br>
 a state of such helpless dejection, that she allowed Crevel to
kneel<br>
 at her feet, kissing her hands.</p>

<p>"Good God! what will become of us!" she went on, wiping away
her<br>
 tears. "Can a mother sit still and see her child pine away
before her<br>
 eyes? What is to be the fate of that splendid creature, as
strong in<br>
 her pure life under her mother's care as she is by every gift
of<br>
 nature? There are days when she wanders round the garden, out
of<br>
 spirits without knowing why; I find her with tears in her
eyes----"</p>

<p>"She is one-and-twenty," said Crevel.</p>

<p>"Must I place her in a convent?" asked the Baroness. "But in
such<br>
 cases religion is impotent to subdue nature, and the most
piously<br>
 trained girls lose their head!--Get up, pray, monsieur; do you
not<br>
 understand that everything is final between us? that I look upon
you<br>
 with horror? that you have crushed a mother's last
hopes----"</p>

<p>"But if I were to restore them," asked he.</p>

<p>Madame Hulot looked at Crevel with a frenzied expression that
really<br>
 touched him. But he drove pity back to the depths of his heart;
she<br>
 had said, "I look upon you with horror."</p>

<p>Virtue is always a little too rigid; it overlooks the shades
and<br>
 instincts by help of which we are able to tack when in a
false<br>
 position.</p>

<p>"So handsome a girl as Mademoiselle Hortense does not find a
husband<br>
 nowadays if she is penniless," Crevel remarked, resuming his<br>
 starchiest manner. "Your daughter is one of those beauties who
rather<br>
 alarm intending husbands; like a thoroughbred horse, which is
too<br>
 expensive to keep up to find a ready purchaser. If you go out
walking<br>
 with such a woman on your arm, every one will turn to look at
you, and<br>
 follow and covet his neighbor's wife. Such success is a source
of much<br>
 uneasiness to men who do not want to be killing lovers; for,
after<br>
 all, no man kills more than one. In the position in which you
find<br>
 yourself there are just three ways of getting your daughter
married:<br>
 Either by my help--and you will have none of it! That is
one.--Or by<br>
 finding some old man of sixty, very rich, childless, and anxious
to<br>
 have children; that is difficult, still such men are to be met
with.<br>
 Many old men take up with a Josepha, a Jenny Cadine, why should
not<br>
 one be found who is ready to make a fool of himself under
legal<br>
 formalities? If it were not for Celestine and our two
grandchildren, I<br>
 would marry Hortense myself. That is two.--The last way is
the<br>
 easiest----"</p>

<p>Madame Hulot raised her head, and looked uneasily at the
ex-perfumer.</p>

<p>"Paris is a town whither every man of energy--and they sprout
like<br>
 saplings on French soil--comes to meet his kind; talent swarms
here<br>
 without hearth or home, and energy equal to anything, even to
making a<br>
 fortune. Well, these youngsters--your humble servant was such a
one in<br>
 his time, and how many he has known! What had du Tillet or
Popinot<br>
 twenty years since? They were both pottering round in Daddy<br>
 Birotteau's shop, with not a penny of capital but their
determination<br>
 to get on, which, in my opinion, is the best capital a man can
have.<br>
 Money may be eaten through, but you don't eat through your<br>
 determination. Why, what had I? The will to get on, and plenty
of<br>
 pluck. At this day du Tillet is a match for the greatest folks;
little<br>
 Popinot, the richest druggist of the Rue des Lombards, became
a<br>
 deputy, now he is in office.--Well, one of these free lances, as
we<br>
 say on the stock market, of the pen, or of the brush, is the
only man<br>
 in Paris who would marry a penniless beauty, for they have
courage<br>
 enough for anything. Monsieur Popinot married Mademoiselle
Birotteau<br>
 without asking for a farthing. Those men are madmen, to be sure!
They<br>
 trust in love as they trust in good luck and brains!--Find a man
of<br>
 energy who will fall in love with your daughter, and he will
marry<br>
 without a thought of money. You must confess that by way of an
enemy I<br>
 am not ungenerous, for this advice is against my own
interests."</p>

<p>"Oh, Monsieur Crevel, if you would indeed be my friend and
give up<br>
 your ridiculous notions----"</p>

<p>"Ridiculous? Madame, do not run yourself down. Look at
yourself--I<br>
 love you, and you will come to be mine. The day will come when I
shall<br>
 say to Hulot, 'You took Josepha, I have taken your wife!'</p>

<p>"It is the old law of tit-for-tat! And I will persevere till I
have<br>
 attained my end, unless you should become extremely ugly.--I
shall<br>
 succeed; and I will tell you why," he went on, resuming his
attitude,<br>
 and looking at Madame Hulot. "You will not meet with such an old
man,<br>
 or such a young lover," he said after a pause, "because you love
your<br>
 daughter too well to hand her over to the manoeuvres of an
old<br>
 libertine, and because you--the Baronne Hulot, sister of the
old<br>
 Lieutenant-General who commanded the veteran Grenadiers of the
Old<br>
 Guard--will not condescend to take a man of spirit wherever you
may<br>
 find him; for he might be a mere craftsman, as many a
millionaire of<br>
 to-day was ten years ago, a working artisan, or the foreman of
a<br>
 factory.</p>

<p><br>
 "And then, when you see the girl, urged by her twenty years,
capable<br>
 of dishonoring you all, you will say to yourself, 'It will be
better<br>
 that I should fall! If Monsieur Crevel will but keep my secret,
I will<br>
 earn my daughter's portion--two hundred thousand francs for ten
years'<br>
 attachment to that old gloveseller--old Crevel!'--I disgust you
no<br>
 doubt, and what I am saying is horribly immoral, you think? But
if you<br>
 happened to have been bitten by an overwhelming passion, you
would<br>
 find a thousand arguments in favor of yielding--as women do when
they<br>
 are in love.--Yes, and Hortense's interests will suggest to
your<br>
 feelings such terms of surrendering your conscience----"</p>

<p>"Hortense has still an uncle."</p>

<p>"What! Old Fischer? He is winding up his concerns, and that
again is<br>
 the Baron's fault; his rake is dragged over every till within
his<br>
 reach."</p>

<p>"Comte Hulot----"</p>

<p>"Oh, madame, your husband has already made thin air of the
old<br>
 General's savings. He spent them in furnishing his singer's
rooms.--<br>
 Now, come; am I to go without a hope?"</p>

<p>"Good-bye, monsieur. A man easily gets over a passion for a
woman of<br>
 my age, and you will fall back on Christian principles. God
takes care<br>
 of the wretched----"</p>

<p>The Baroness rose to oblige the captain to retreat, and drove
him back<br>
 into the drawing-room.</p>

<p>"Ought the beautiful Madame Hulot to be living amid such
squalor?"<br>
 said he, and he pointed to an old lamp, a chandelier bereft of
its<br>
 gilding, the threadbare carpet, the very rags of wealth which
made the<br>
 large room, with its red, white, and gold, look like a corpse
of<br>
 Imperial festivities.</p>

<p>"Monsieur, virtue shines on it all. I have no wish to owe a
handsome<br>
 abode to having made of the beauty you are pleased to ascribe to
me a<br>
 <i>man-trap</i> and <i>a money-box for five-franc
pieces</i>!"</p>

<p>The captain bit his lips as he recognized the words he had
used to<br>
 vilify Josepha's avarice.</p>

<p>"And for whom are you so magnanimous?" said he. By this time
the<br>
 baroness had got her rejected admirer as far as the door.--"For
a<br>
 libertine!" said he, with a lofty grimace of virtue and
superior<br>
 wealth.</p>

<p>"If you are right, my constancy has some merit, monsieur. That
is<br>
 all."</p>

<p>After bowing to the officer as a woman bows to dismiss an
importune<br>
 visitor, she turned away too quickly to see him once more fold
his<br>
 arms. She unlocked the doors she had closed, and did not see
the<br>
 threatening gesture which was Crevel's parting greeting. She
walked<br>
 with a proud, defiant step, like a martyr to the Coliseum, but
her<br>
 strength was exhausted; she sank on the sofa in her blue room,
as if<br>
 she were ready to faint, and sat there with her eyes fixed on
the<br>
 tumble-down summer-house, where her daughter was gossiping with
Cousin<br>
 Betty.</p>

<p>From the first days of her married life to the present time
the<br>
 Baroness had loved her husband, as Josephine in the end had
loved<br>
 Napoleon, with an admiring, maternal, and cowardly devotion.
Though<br>
 ignorant of the details given her by Crevel, she knew that for
twenty<br>
 years past Baron Hulot been anything rather than a faithful
husband;<br>
 but she had sealed her eyes with lead, she had wept in silence,
and no<br>
 word of reproach had ever escaped her. In return for this
angelic<br>
 sweetness, she had won her husband's veneration and
something<br>
 approaching to worship from all who were about her.</p>

<p>A wife's affection for her husband and the respect she pays
him are<br>
 infectious in a family. Hortense believed her father to be a
perfect<br>
 model of conjugal affection; as to their son, brought up to
admire the<br>
 Baron, whom everybody regarded as one of the giants who so
effectually<br>
 backed Napoleon, he knew that he owed his advancement to his
father's<br>
 name, position, and credit; and besides, the impressions of
childhood<br>
 exert an enduring influence. He still was afraid of his father;
and if<br>
 he had suspected the misdeeds revealed by Crevel, as he was too
much<br>
 overawed by him to find fault, he would have found excuses in
the view<br>
 every man takes of such matters.</p>

<p>It now will be necessary to give the reasons for the
extraordinary<br>
 self-devotion of a good and beautiful woman; and this, in a few
words,<br>
 is her past history.</p>

<p>Three brothers, simple laboring men, named Fischer, and living
in a<br>
 village situated on the furthest frontier of Lorraine, were
compelled<br>
 by the Republican conscription to set out with the so-called
army of<br>
 the Rhine.</p>

<p>In 1799 the second brother, Andre, a widower, and Madame
Hulot's<br>
 father, left his daughter to the care of his elder brother,
Pierre<br>
 Fischer, disabled from service by a wound received in 1797, and
made a<br>
 small private venture in the military transport service, an
opening he<br>
 owed to the favor of Hulot d'Ervy, who was high in the
commissariat.<br>
 By a very obvious chance Hulot, coming to Strasbourg, saw the
Fischer<br>
 family. Adeline's father and his younger brother were at that
time<br>
 contractors for forage in the province of Alsace.</p>

<p>Adeline, then sixteen years of age, might be compared with the
famous<br>
 Madame du Barry, like her, a daughter of Lorraine. She was one
of<br>
 those perfect and striking beauties--a woman like Madame
Tallien,<br>
 finished with peculiar care by Nature, who bestows on them all
her<br>
 choicest gifts--distinction, dignity, grace, refinement,
elegance,<br>
 flesh of a superior texture, and a complexion mingled in the
unknown<br>
 laboratory where good luck presides. These beautiful creatures
all<br>
 have something in common: Bianca Capella, whose portrait is one
of<br>
 Bronzino's masterpieces; Jean Goujon's Venus, painted from the
famous<br>
 Diane de Poitiers; Signora Olympia, whose picture adorns the
Doria<br>
 gallery; Ninon, Madame du Barry, Madame Tallien, Mademoiselle
Georges,<br>
 Madame Recamier.--all these women who preserved their beauty in
spite<br>
 of years, of passion, and of their life of excess and pleasure,
have<br>
 in figure, frame, and in the character of their beauty
certain<br>
 striking resemblances, enough to make one believe that there is
in the<br>
 ocean of generations an Aphrodisian current whence every such
Venus is<br>
 born, all daughters of the same salt wave.</p>

<p>Adeline Fischer, one of the loveliest of this race of
goddesses, had<br>
 the splendid type, the flowing lines, the exquisite texture of a
woman<br>
 born a queen. The fair hair that our mother Eve received from
the hand<br>
 of God, the form of an Empress, an air of grandeur, and an
august line<br>
 of profile, with her rural modesty, made every man pause in
delight as<br>
 she passed, like amateurs in front of a Raphael; in short,
having once<br>
 seen her, the Commissariat officer made Mademoiselle Adeline
Fischer<br>
 his wife as quickly as the law would permit, to the great
astonishment<br>
 of the Fischers, who had all been brought up in the fear of
their<br>
 betters.</p>

<p>The eldest, a soldier of 1792, severely wounded in the attack
on the<br>
 lines at Wissembourg, adored the Emperor Napoleon and everything
that<br>
 had to do with the <i>Grande Armee</i>. Andre and Johann spoke
with respect<br>
 of Commissary Hulot, the Emperor's protege, to whom indeed they
owed<br>
 their prosperity; for Hulot d'Ervy, finding them intelligent
and<br>
 honest, had taken them from the army provision wagons to place
them in<br>
 charge of a government contract needing despatch. The brothers
Fischer<br>
 had done further service during the campaign of 1804. At the
peace<br>
 Hulot had secured for them the contract for forage from Alsace,
not<br>
 knowing that he would presently be sent to Strasbourg to prepare
for<br>
 the campaign of 1806.</p>

<p>This marriage was like an Assumption to the young peasant
girl. The<br>
 beautiful Adeline was translated at once from the mire of her
village<br>
 to the paradise of the Imperial Court; for the contractor, one
of the<br>
 most conscientious and hard-working of the Commissariat staff,
was<br>
 made a Baron, obtained a place near the Emperor, and was
attached to<br>
 the Imperial Guard. The handsome rustic bravely set to work to
educate<br>
 herself for love of her husband, for she was simply crazy about
him;<br>
 and, indeed, the Commissariat office was as a man a perfect
match for<br>
 Adeline as a woman. He was one of the picked corps of fine men.
Tall,<br>
 well-built, fair, with beautiful blue eyes full of irresistible
fire<br>
 and life, his elegant appearance made him remarkable by the side
of<br>
 d'Orsay, Forbin, Ouvrard; in short, in the battalion of fine men
that<br>
 surrounded the Emperor. A conquering "buck," and holding the
ideas of<br>
 the Directoire with regard to women, his career of gallantry
was<br>
 interrupted for some long time by his conjugal affection.</p>

<p>To Adeline the Baron was from the first a sort of god who
could do no<br>
 wrong. To him she owed everything: fortune--she had a carriage,
a fine<br>
 house, every luxury of the day; happiness--he was devoted to her
in<br>
 the face of the world; a title, for she was a Baroness; fame,
for she<br>
 was spoken of as the beautiful Madame Hulot--and in Paris!
Finally,<br>
 she had the honor of refusing the Emperor's advances, for
Napoleon<br>
 made her a present of a diamond necklace, and always remembered
her,<br>
 asking now and again, "And is the beautiful Madame Hulot still a
model<br>
 of virtue?" in the tone of a man who might have taken his
revenge on<br>
 one who should have triumphed where he had failed.</p>

<p>So it needs no great intuition to discern what were the
motives in a<br>
 simple, guileless, and noble soul for the fanaticism of Madame
Hulot's<br>
 love. Having fully persuaded herself that her husband could do
her no<br>
 wrong, she made herself in the depths of her heart the humble,
abject,<br>
 and blindfold slave of the man who had made her. It must be
noted,<br>
 too, that she was gifted with great good sense--the good sense
of the<br>
 people, which made her education sound. In society she spoke
little,<br>
 and never spoke evil of any one; she did not try to shine; she
thought<br>
 out many things, listened well, and formed herself on the model
of the<br>
 best-conducted women of good birth.</p>

<p>In 1815 Hulot followed the lead of the Prince de Wissembourg,
his<br>
 intimate friend, and became one of the officers who organized
the<br>
 improvised troops whose rout brought the Napoleonic cycle to a
close<br>
 at Waterloo. In 1816 the Baron was one of the men best hated by
the<br>
 Feltre administration, and was not reinstated in the
Commissariat till<br>
 1823, when he was needed for the Spanish war. In 1830 he took
office<br>
 as the fourth wheel of the coach, at the time of the levies, a
sort of<br>
 conscription made by Louis Philippe on the old Napoleonic
soldiery.<br>
 From the time when the younger branch ascended the throne,
having<br>
 taken an active part in bringing that about, he was regarded as
an<br>
 indispensable authority at the War Office. He had already won
his<br>
 Marshal's baton, and the King could do no more for him unless
by<br>
 making him minister or a peer of France.</p>

<p>From 1818 till 1823, having no official occupation, Baron
Hulot had<br>
 gone on active service to womankind. Madame Hulot dated her
Hector's<br>
 first infidelities from the grand <i>finale</i> of the Empire.
Thus, for<br>
 twelve years the Baroness had filled the part in her household
of<br>
 <i>prima donna assoluta</i>, without a rival. She still could
boast of the<br>
 old-fashioned, inveterate affection which husbands feel for
wives who<br>
 are resigned to be gentle and virtuous helpmates; she knew that
if she<br>
 had a rival, that rival would not subsist for two hours under a
word<br>
 of reproof from herself; but she shut her eyes, she stopped her
ears,<br>
 she would know nothing of her husband's proceedings outside his
home.<br>
 In short, she treated her Hector as a mother treats a spoilt
child.</p>

<p>Three years before the conversation reported above, Hortense,
at the<br>
 Theatre des Varietes, had recognized her father in a lower tier
stage-<br>
 box with Jenny Cadine, and had exclaimed:</p>

<p>"There is papa!"</p>

<p>"You are mistaken, my darling; he is at the Marshal's," the
Baroness<br>
 replied.</p>

<p>She too had seen Jenny Cadine; but instead of feeling a pang
when she<br>
 saw how pretty she was, she said to herself, "That rascal Hector
must<br>
 think himself very lucky."</p>

<p>She suffered nevertheless; she gave herself up in secret to
rages of<br>
 torment; but as soon as she saw Hector, she always remembered
her<br>
 twelve years of perfect happiness, and could not find it in her
to<br>
 utter a word of complaint. She would have been glad if the Baron
would<br>
 have taken her into his confidence; but she never dared to let
him see<br>
 that she knew of his kicking over the traces, out of respect for
her<br>
 husband. Such an excess of delicacy is never met with but in
those<br>
 grand creatures, daughters of the soil, whose instinct it is to
take<br>
 blows without ever returning them; the blood of the early
martyrs<br>
 still lives in their veins. Well-born women, their husbands'
equals,<br>
 feel the impulse to annoy them, to mark the points of their
tolerance,<br>
 like points at billiards, by some stinging word, partly in the
spirit<br>
 of diabolical malice, and to secure the upper hand or the right
of<br>
 turning the tables.</p>

<p><br>
 The Baroness had an ardent admirer in her brother-in-law,
Lieutenant-<br>
 General Hulot, the venerable Colonel of the Grenadiers of the
Imperial<br>
 Infantry Guard, who was to have a Marshal's baton in his old
age. This<br>
 veteran, after having served from 1830 to 1834 as Commandant of
the<br>
 military division, including the departments of Brittany, the
scene of<br>
 his exploits in 1799 and 1800, had come to settle in Paris near
his<br>
 brother, for whom he had a fatherly affection.</p>

<p>This old soldier's heart was in sympathy with his
sister-in-law; he<br>
 admired her as the noblest and saintliest of her sex. He had
never<br>
 married, because he hoped to find a second Adeline, though he
had<br>
 vainly sought for her through twenty campaigns in as many lands.
To<br>
 maintain her place in the esteem of this blameless and spotless
old<br>
 republican--of whom Napoleon had said, "That brave old Hulot is
the<br>
 most obstinate republican, but he will never be false to
me"--Adeline<br>
 would have endured griefs even greater than those that had just
come<br>
 upon her. But the old soldier, seventy-two years of age,
battered by<br>
 thirty campaigns, and wounded for the twenty-seventh time at
Waterloo,<br>
 was Adeline's admirer, and not a "protector." The poor old
Count,<br>
 among other infirmities, could only hear through a speaking
trumpet.</p>

<p>So long as Baron Hulot d'Ervy was a fine man, his flirtations
did not<br>
 damage his fortune; but when a man is fifty, the Graces claim
payment.<br>
 At that age love becomes vice; insensate vanities come into
play.<br>
 Thus, at about that time, Adeline saw that her husband was
incredibly<br>
 particular about his dress; he dyed his hair and whiskers, and
wore a<br>
 belt and stays. He was determined to remain handsome at any
cost. This<br>
 care of his person, a weakness he had once mercilessly mocked
at, was<br>
 carried out in the minutest details.</p>

<p>At last Adeline perceived that the Pactolus poured out before
the<br>
 Baron's mistresses had its source in her pocket. In eight years
he had<br>
 dissipated a considerable amount of money; and so effectually,
that,<br>
 on his son's marriage two years previously, the Baron had
been<br>
 compelled to explain to his wife that his pay constituted their
whole<br>
 income.</p>

<p>"What shall we come to?" asked Adeline.</p>

<p>"Be quite easy," said the official, "I will leave the whole of
my<br>
 salary in your hands, and I will make a fortune for Hortense,
and some<br>
 savings for the future, in business."</p>

<p>The wife's deep belief in her husband's power and superior
talents, in<br>
 his capabilities and character, had, in fact, for the moment
allayed<br>
 her anxiety.</p>

<p>What the Baroness' reflections and tears were after Crevel's
departure<br>
 may now be clearly imagined. The poor woman had for two years
past<br>
 known that she was at the bottom of a pit, but she had fancied
herself<br>
 alone in it. How her son's marriage had been finally arranged
she had<br>
 not known; she had known nothing of Hector's connection with
the<br>
 grasping Jewess; and, above all, she hoped that no one in the
world<br>
 knew anything of her troubles. Now, if Crevel went about so
ready to<br>
 talk of the Baron's excesses, Hector's reputation would suffer.
She<br>
 could see, under the angry ex-perfumer's coarse harangue, the
odious<br>
 gossip behind the scenes which led to her son's marriage.
Two<br>
 reprobate hussies had been the priestesses of this union planned
at<br>
 some orgy amid the degrading familiarities of two tipsy old
sinners.</p>

<p>"And has he forgotten Hortense!" she wondered.</p>

<p>"But he sees her every day; will he try to find her a husband
among<br>
 his good-for-nothing sluts?"</p>

<p>At this moment it was the mother that spoke rather than the
wife, for<br>
 she saw Hortense laughing with her Cousin Betty--the reckless
laughter<br>
 of heedless youth; and she knew that such hysterical laughter
was<br>
 quite as distressing a symptom as the tearful reverie of
solitary<br>
 walks in the garden.</p>

<p>Hortense was like her mother, with golden hair that waved
naturally,<br>
 and was amazingly long and thick. Her skin had the lustre of
mother-<br>
 of-pearl. She was visibly the offspring of a true marriage, of a
pure<br>
 and noble love in its prime. There was a passionate vitality in
her<br>
 countenance, a brilliancy of feature, a full fount of youth, a
fresh<br>
 vigor and abundance of health, which radiated from her with
electric<br>
 flashes. Hortense invited the eye.</p>

<p>When her eye, of deep ultramarine blue, liquid with the
moisture of<br>
 innocent youth, rested on a passer-by, he was involuntarily
thrilled.<br>
 Nor did a single freckle mar her skin, such as those with which
many a<br>
 white and golden maid pays toll for her milky whiteness. Tall,
round<br>
 without being fat, with a slender dignity as noble as her
mother's,<br>
 she really deserved the name of goddess, of which old authors
were so<br>
 lavish. In fact, those who saw Hortense in the street could
hardly<br>
 restrain the exclamation, "What a beautiful girl!"</p>

<p>She was so genuinely innocent, that she could say to her
mother:</p>

<p>"What do they mean, mamma, by calling me a beautiful girl when
I am<br>
 with you? Are not you much handsomer than I am?"</p>

<p>And, in point of fact, at seven-and-forty the Baroness might
have been<br>
 preferred to her daughter by amateurs of sunset beauty; for she
had<br>
 not yet lost any of her charms, by one of those phenomena which
are<br>
 especially rare in Paris, where Ninon was regarded as
scandalous,<br>
 simply because she thus seemed to enjoy such an unfair advantage
over<br>
 the plainer women of the seventeenth century.</p>

<p>Thinking of her daughter brought her back to the father; she
saw him<br>
 sinking by degrees, day after day, down to the social mire, and
even<br>
 dismissed some day from his appointment. The idea of her idol's
fall,<br>
 with a vague vision of the disasters prophesied by Crevel, was
such a<br>
 terror to the poor woman, that she became rapt in the
contemplation<br>
 like an ecstatic.</p>

<p>Cousin Betty, from time to time, as she chatted with Hortense,
looked<br>
 round to see when they might return to the drawing-room; but her
young<br>
 cousin was pelting her with questions, and at the moment when
the<br>
 Baroness opened the glass door she did not happen to be
looking.</p>

<p>Lisbeth Fischer, though the daughter of the eldest of the
three<br>
 brothers, was five years younger than Madame Hulot; she was far
from<br>
 being as handsome as her cousin, and had been desperately
jealous of<br>
 Adeline. Jealousy was the fundamental passion of this
character,<br>
 marked by eccentricities--a word invented by the English to
describe<br>
 the craziness not of the asylum, but of respectable households.
A<br>
 native of the Vosges, a peasant in the fullest sense of the
word,<br>
 lean, brown, with shining black hair and thick eyebrows joining
in a<br>
 tuft, with long, strong arms, thick feet, and some moles on her
narrow<br>
 simian face--such is a brief description of the elderly
virgin.</p>

<p>The family, living all under one roof, had sacrificed the
common-<br>
 looking girl to the beauty, the bitter fruit to the splendid
flower.<br>
 Lisbeth worked in the fields, while her cousin was indulged; and
one<br>
 day, when they were alone together, she had tried to destroy
Adeline's<br>
 nose, a truly Greek nose, which the old mothers admired. Though
she<br>
 was beaten for this misdeed, she persisted nevertheless in
tearing the<br>
 favorite's gowns and crumpling her collars.</p>

<p>At the time of Adeline's wonderful marriage, Lisbeth had bowed
to<br>
 fate, as Napoleon's brothers and sisters bowed before the
splendor of<br>
 the throne and the force of authority.</p>

<p>Adeline, who was extremely sweet and kind, remembered Lisbeth
when she<br>
 found herself in Paris, and invited her there in 1809, intending
to<br>
 rescue her from poverty by finding her a husband. But seeing
that it<br>
 was impossible to marry the girl out of hand, with her black
eyes and<br>
 sooty brows, unable, too, to read or write, the Baron began
by<br>
 apprenticing her to a business; he placed her as a learner with
the<br>
 embroiderers to the Imperial Court, the well-known Pons
Brothers.</p>

<p>Lisbeth, called Betty for short, having learned to embroider
in gold<br>
 and silver, and possessing all the energy of a mountain race,
had<br>
 determination enough to learn to read, write, and keep accounts;
for<br>
 her cousin the Baron had pointed out the necessity for these<br>
 accomplishments if she hoped to set up in business as an
embroiderer.</p>

<p>She was bent on making a fortune; in two years she was
another<br>
 creature. In 1811 the peasant woman had become a very
presentable,<br>
 skilled, and intelligent forewoman.</p>

<p>Her department, that of gold and silver lace-work, as it is
called,<br>
 included epaulettes, sword-knots, aiguillettes; in short, the
immense<br>
 mass of glittering ornaments that sparkled on the rich uniforms
of the<br>
 French army and civil officials. The Emperor, a true Italian in
his<br>
 love of dress, had overlaid the coats of all his servants with
silver<br>
 and gold, and the Empire included a hundred and thirty-three<br>
 Departments. These ornaments, usually supplied to tailors who
were<br>
 solvent and wealthy paymasters, were a very secure branch of
trade.</p>

<p>Just when Cousin Betty, the best hand in the house of Pons
Brothers,<br>
 where she was forewoman of the embroidery department, might have
set<br>
 up in business on her own account, the Empire collapsed. The
olive-<br>
 branch of peace held out by the Bourbons did not reassure
Lisbeth; she<br>
 feared a diminution of this branch of trade, since henceforth
there<br>
 were to be but eighty-six Departments to plunder, instead of a
hundred<br>
 and thirty-three, to say nothing of the immense reduction of the
army.<br>
 Utterly scared by the ups and downs of industry, she refused
the<br>
 Baron's offers of help, and he thought she must be mad. She
confirmed<br>
 this opinion by quarreling with Monsieur Rivet, who bought
the<br>
 business of Pons Brothers, and with whom the Baron wished to
place her<br>
 in partnership; she would be no more than a workwoman. Thus
the<br>
 Fischer family had relapsed into the precarious mediocrity from
which<br>
 Baron Hulot had raised it.</p>

<p>The three brothers Fischer, who had been ruined by the
abdication at<br>
 Fontainebleau, in despair joined the irregular troops in 1815.
The<br>
 eldest, Lisbeth's father, was killed. Adeline's father,
sentenced to<br>
 death by court-martial, fled to Germany, and died at Treves in
1820.<br>
 Johann, the youngest, came to Paris, a petitioner to the queen
of the<br>
 family, who was said to dine off gold and silver plate, and
never to<br>
 be seen at a party but with diamonds in her hair as big as
hazel-nuts,<br>
 given to her by the Emperor.</p>

<p>Johann Fischer, then aged forty-three, obtained from Baron
Hulot a<br>
 capital of ten thousand francs with which to start a small
business as<br>
 forage-dealer at Versailles, under the patronage of the War
Office,<br>
 through the influence of the friends still in office, of the
late<br>
 Commissary-General.</p>

<p>These family catastrophes, Baron Hulot's dismissal, and the
knowledge<br>
 that he was a mere cipher in that immense stir of men and
interests<br>
 and things which makes Paris at once a paradise and a hell,
quite<br>
 quelled Lisbeth Fischer. She gave up all idea of rivalry and<br>
 comparison with her cousin after feeling her great superiority;
but<br>
 envy still lurked in her heart, like a plague-germ that may
hatch and<br>
 devastate a city if the fatal bale of wool is opened in which it
is<br>
 concealed.</p>

<p>Now and again, indeed, she said to herself:</p>

<p>"Adeline and I are the same flesh and blood, our fathers were
brothers<br>
 --and she is in a mansion, while I am in a garret."</p>

<p>But every New Year Lisbeth had presents from the Baron and
Baroness;<br>
 the Baron, who was always good to her, paid for her firewood in
the<br>
 winter; old General Hulot had her to dinner once a week; and
there was<br>
 always a cover laid for her at her cousin's table. They laughed
at her<br>
 no doubt, but they never were ashamed to own her. In short, they
had<br>
 made her independent in Paris, where she lived as she
pleased.</p>

<p>The old maid had, in fact, a terror of any kind of tie. Her
cousin had<br>
 offered her a room in her own house--Lisbeth suspected the
halter of<br>
 domestic servitude; several times the Baron had found a solution
of<br>
 the difficult problem of her marriage; but though tempted in the
first<br>
 instance, she would presently decline, fearing lest she should
be<br>
 scorned for her want of education, her general ignorance, and
her<br>
 poverty; finally, when the Baroness suggested that she should
live<br>
 with their uncle Johann, and keep house for him, instead of the
upper<br>
 servant, who must cost him dear, Lisbeth replied that that was
the<br>
 very last way she should think of marrying.</p>

<p>Lisbeth Fischer had the sort of strangeness in her ideas which
is<br>
 often noticeable in characters that have developed late, in
savages,<br>
 who think much and speak little. Her peasant's wit had acquired
a good<br>
 deal of Parisian asperity from hearing the talk of workshops
and<br>
 mixing with workmen and workwomen. She, whose character had a
marked<br>
 resemblance to that of the Corsicans, worked upon without
fruition by<br>
 the instincts of a strong nature, would have liked to be the<br>
 protectress of a weak man; but, as a result of living in the
capital,<br>
 the capital had altered her superficially. Parisian polish
became rust<br>
 on this coarsely tempered soul. Gifted with a cunning which had
become<br>
 unfathomable, as it always does in those whose celibacy is
genuine,<br>
 with the originality and sharpness with which she clothed her
ideas,<br>
 in any other position she would have been formidable. Full of
spite,<br>
 she was capable of bringing discord into the most united
family.</p>

<p>In early days, when she indulged in certain secret hopes which
she<br>
 confided to none, she took to wearing stays, and dressing in
the<br>
 fashion, and so shone in splendor for a short time, that the
Baron<br>
 thought her marriageable. Lisbeth at that stage was the
piquante<br>
 brunette of old-fashioned novels. Her piercing glance, her olive
skin,<br>
 her reed-like figure, might invite a half-pay major; but she
was<br>
 satisfied, she would say laughing, with her own admiration.</p>

<p>And, indeed, she found her life pleasant enough when she had
freed it<br>
 from practical anxieties, for she dined out every evening
after<br>
 working hard from sunrise. Thus she had only her rent and her
midday<br>
 meal to provide for; she had most of her clothes given her, and
a<br>
 variety of very acceptable stores, such as coffee, sugar, wine,
and so<br>
 forth.</p>

<p>In 1837, after living for twenty-seven years, half maintained
by the<br>
 Hulots and her Uncle Fischer, Cousin Betty, resigned to being
nobody,<br>
 allowed herself to be treated so. She herself refused to appear
at any<br>
 grand dinners, preferring the family party, where she held her
own and<br>
 was spared all slights to her pride.</p>

<p>Wherever she went--at General Hulot's, at Crevel's, at the
house of<br>
 the young Hulots, or at Rivet's (Pons' successor, with whom she
made<br>
 up her quarrel, and who made much of her), and at the Baroness'
table<br>
 --she was treated as one of the family; in fact, she managed to
make<br>
 friends of the servants by making them an occasional small
present,<br>
 and always gossiping with them for a few minutes before going
into the<br>
 drawing-room. This familiarity, by which she uncompromisingly
put<br>
 herself on their level, conciliated their servile good-nature,
which<br>
 is indispensable to a parasite. "She is a good, steady woman,"
was<br>
 everybody's verdict.</p>

<p>Her willingness to oblige, which knew no bounds when it was
not<br>
 demanded of her, was indeed, like her assumed bluntness, a
necessity<br>
 of her position. She had at length understood what her life must
be,<br>
 seeing that she was at everybody's mercy; and needing to
please<br>
 everybody, she would laugh with young people, who liked her for
a sort<br>
 of wheedling flattery which always wins them; guessing and
taking part<br>
 with their fancies, she would make herself their spokeswoman,
and they<br>
 thought her a delightful <i>confidante</i>, since she had no
right to find<br>
 fault with them.</p>

<p>Her absolute secrecy also won her the confidence of their
seniors;<br>
 for, like Ninon, she had certain manly qualities. As a rule,
our<br>
 confidence is given to those below rather than above us. We
employ our<br>
 inferiors rather than our betters in secret transactions, and
they<br>
 thus become the recipients of our inmost thoughts, and look on
at our<br>
 meditations; Richelieu thought he had achieved success when he
was<br>
 admitted to the Council. This penniless woman was supposed to be
so<br>
 dependent on every one about her, that she seemed doomed to
perfect<br>
 silence. She herself called herself the Family Confessional.</p>

<p><br>
 The Baroness only, remembering her ill-usage in childhood by
the<br>
 cousin who, though younger, was stronger than herself, never
wholly<br>
 trusted her. Besides, out of sheer modesty, she would never have
told<br>
 her domestic sorrows to any one but God.</p>

<p>It may here be well to add that the Baron's house preserved
all its<br>
 magnificence in the eyes of Lisbeth Fischer, who was not struck,
as<br>
 the parvenu perfumer had been, with the penury stamped on the
shabby<br>
 chairs, the dirty hangings, and the ripped silk. The furniture
we live<br>
 with is in some sort like our own person; seeing ourselves every
day,<br>
 we end, like the Baron, by thinking ourselves but little
altered, and<br>
 still youthful, when others see that our head is covered
with<br>
 chinchilla, our forehead scarred with circumflex accents, our
stomach<br>
 assuming the rotundity of a pumpkin. So these rooms, always
blazing in<br>
 Betty's eyes with the Bengal fire of Imperial victory, were to
her<br>
 perennially splendid.</p>

<p>As time went on, Lisbeth had contracted some rather strange
old-<br>
 maidish habits. For instance, instead of following the fashions,
she<br>
 expected the fashion to accept her ways and yield to her always
out-<br>
 of-date notions. When the Baroness gave her a pretty new bonnet,
or a<br>
 gown in the fashion of the day, Betty remade it completely at
home,<br>
 and spoilt it by producing a dress of the style of the Empire or
of<br>
 her old Lorraine costume. A thirty-franc bonnet came out a rag,
and<br>
 the gown a disgrace. On this point, Lisbeth was as obstinate as
a<br>
 mule; she would please no one but herself and believed
herself<br>
 charming; whereas this assimilative process--harmonious, no
doubt, in<br>
 so far as that it stamped her for an old maid from head to
foot--made<br>
 her so ridiculous, that, with the best will in the world, no one
could<br>
 admit her on any smart occasion.</p>

<p>This refractory, capricious, and independent spirit, and
the<br>
 inexplicable wild shyness of the woman for whom the Baron had
four<br>
 times found a match--an employe in his office, a retired major,
an<br>
 army contractor, and a half-pay captain--while she had refused
an army<br>
 lacemaker, who had since made his fortune, had won her the name
of the<br>
 Nanny Goat, which the Baron gave her in jest. But this nickname
only<br>
 met the peculiarities that lay on the surface, the
eccentricities<br>
 which each of us displays to his neighbors in social life. This
woman,<br>
 who, if closely studied, would have shown the most savage traits
of<br>
 the peasant class, was still the girl who had clawed her
cousin's<br>
 nose, and who, if she had not been trained to reason, would
perhaps<br>
 have killed her in a fit of jealousy.</p>

<p>It was only her knowledge of the laws and of the world that
enabled<br>
 her to control the swift instinct with which country folk, like
wild<br>
 men, reduce impulse to action. In this alone, perhaps, lies
the<br>
 difference between natural and civilized man. The savage has
only<br>
 impulse; the civilized man has impulses and ideas. And in the
savage<br>
 the brain retains, as we may say, but few impressions, it is
wholly at<br>
 the mercy of the feeling that rushes in upon it; while in
the<br>
 civilized man, ideas sink into the heart and change it; he has
a<br>
 thousand interests and many feelings, where the savage has but
one at<br>
 a time. This is the cause of the transient ascendency of a child
over<br>
 its parents, which ceases as soon as it is satisfied; in the man
who<br>
 is still one with nature, this contrast is constant. Cousin
Betty, a<br>
 savage of Lorraine, somewhat treacherous too, was of this class
of<br>
 natures, which are commoner among the lower orders than is
supposed,<br>
 accounting for the conduct of the populace during
revolutions.</p>

<p>At the time when this <i>Drama</i> opens, if Cousin Betty
would have<br>
 allowed herself to be dressed like other people; if, like the
women of<br>
 Paris, she had been accustomed to wear each fashion in its turn,
she<br>
 would have been presentable and acceptable, but she preserved
the<br>
 stiffness of a stick. Now a woman devoid of all the graces, in
Paris<br>
 simply does not exist. The fine but hard eyes, the severe
features,<br>
 the Calabrian fixity of complexion which made Lisbeth like a
figure by<br>
 Giotto, and of which a true Parisian would have taken advantage,
above<br>
 all, her strange way of dressing, gave her such an
extraordinary<br>
 appearance that she sometimes looked like one of those monkeys
in<br>
 petticoats taken about by little Savoyards. As she was well
known in<br>
 the houses connected by family which she frequented, and
restricted<br>
 her social efforts to that little circle, as she liked her own
home,<br>
 her singularities no longer astonished anybody; and out of doors
they<br>
 were lost in the immense stir of Paris street-life, where only
pretty<br>
 women are ever looked at.</p>

<p>Hortense's laughter was at this moment caused by a victory won
over<br>
 her Cousin Lisbeth's perversity; she had just wrung from her an
avowal<br>
 she had been hoping for these three years past. However
secretive an<br>
 old maid may be, there is one sentiment which will always avail
to<br>
 make her break her fast from words, and that is her vanity. For
the<br>
 last three years, Hortense, having become very inquisitive on
such<br>
 matters, had pestered her cousin with questions, which, however,
bore<br>
 the stamp of perfect innocence. She wanted to know why her
cousin had<br>
 never married. Hortense, who knew of the five offers that she
had<br>
 refused, had constructed her little romance; she supposed that
Lisbeth<br>
 had had a passionate attachment, and a war of banter was the
result.<br>
 Hortense would talk of "We young girls!" when speaking of
herself and<br>
 her cousin.</p>

<p>Cousin Betty had on several occasions answered in the same
tone--"And<br>
 who says I have not a lover?" So Cousin Betty's lover, real
or<br>
 fictitious, became a subject of mild jesting. At last, after two
years<br>
 of this petty warfare, the last time Lisbeth had come to the
house<br>
 Hortense's first question had been:</p>

<p>"And how is your lover?"</p>

<p>"Pretty well, thank you," was the answer. "He is rather
ailing, poor<br>
 young man."</p>

<p>"He has delicate health?" asked the Baroness, laughing.</p>

<p>"I should think so! He is fair. A sooty thing like me can love
none<br>
 but a fair man with a color like the moon."</p>

<p>"But who is he? What does he do?" asked Hortense. "Is he a
prince?"</p>

<p>"A prince of artisans, as I am queen of the bobbin. Is a poor
woman<br>
 like me likely to find a lover in a man with a fine house and
money in<br>
 the funds, or in a duke of the realm, or some Prince Charming
out of a<br>
 fairy tale?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I should so much like to see him!" cried Hortense,
smiling.</p>

<p>"To see what a man can be like who can love the Nanny Goat?"
retorted<br>
 Lisbeth.</p>

<p>"He must be some monster of an old clerk, with a goat's
beard!"<br>
 Hortense said to her mother.</p>

<p>"Well, then, you are quite mistaken, mademoiselle."</p>

<p>"Then you mean that you really have a lover?" Hortense
exclaimed in<br>
 triumph.</p>

<p>"As sure as you have not!" retorted Lisbeth, nettled.</p>

<p>"But if you have a lover, why don't you marry him, Lisbeth?"
said the<br>
 Baroness, shaking her head at her daughter. "We have been
hearing<br>
 rumors about him these three years. You have had time to study
him;<br>
 and if he has been faithful so long, you should not persist in a
delay<br>
 which must be hard upon him. After all, it is a matter of
conscience;<br>
 and if he is young, it is time to take a brevet of dignity."</p>

<p>Cousin Betty had fixed her gaze on Adeline, and seeing that
she was<br>
 jesting, she replied:</p>

<p>"It would be marrying hunger and thirst; he is a workman, I am
a<br>
 workwoman. If we had children, they would be workmen.--No, no;
we love<br>
 each other spiritually; it is less expensive."</p>

<p>"Why do you keep him in hiding?" Hortense asked.</p>

<p>"He wears a round jacket," replied the old maid, laughing.</p>

<p>"You truly love him?" the Baroness inquired.</p>

<p>"I believe you! I love him for his own sake, the dear cherub.
For four<br>
 years his home has been in my heart."</p>

<p>"Well, then, if you love him for himself," said the Baroness
gravely,<br>
 "and if he really exists, you are treating him criminally. You
do not<br>
 know how to love truly."</p>

<p>"We all know that from our birth," said Lisbeth.</p>

<p>"No, there are women who love and yet are selfish, and that is
your<br>
 case."</p>

<p>Cousin Betty's head fell, and her glance would have made any
one<br>
 shiver who had seen it; but her eyes were on her reel of
thread.</p>

<p>"If you would introduce your so-called lover to us, Hector
might find<br>
 him employment, or put him in a position to make money."</p>

<p>"That is out of the question," said Cousin Betty.</p>

<p>"And why?"</p>

<p>"He is a sort of Pole--a refugee----"</p>

<p>"A conspirator?" cried Hortense. "What luck for you!--Has he
had any<br>
 adventures?"</p>

<p>"He has fought for Poland. He was a professor in the school
where the<br>
 students began the rebellion; and as he had been placed there by
the<br>
 Grand Duke Constantine, he has no hope of mercy----"</p>

<p>"A professor of what?"</p>

<p>"Of fine arts."</p>

<p>"And he came to Paris when the rebellion was quelled?"</p>

<p>"In 1833. He came through Germany on foot."</p>

<p>"Poor young man! And how old is he?"</p>

<p>"He was just four-and-twenty when the insurrection broke
out--he is<br>
 twenty-nine now."</p>

<p>"Fifteen years your junior," said the Baroness.</p>

<p>"And what does he live on?" asked Hortense.</p>

<p>"His talent."</p>

<p>"Oh, he gives lessons?"</p>

<p>"No," said Cousin Betty; "he gets them, and hard ones
too!"</p>

<p>"And his Christian name--is it a pretty name?"</p>

<p>"Wenceslas."</p>

<p>"What a wonderful imagination you old maids have!" exclaimed
the<br>
 Baroness. "To hear you talk, Lisbeth, one might really believe
you."</p>

<p>"You see, mamma, he is a Pole, and so accustomed to the knout
that<br>
 Lisbeth reminds him of the joys of his native land."</p>

<p>They all three laughed, and Hortense sang <i>Wenceslas! idole
de mon<br>
 ame</i>! instead of <i>O Mathilde.</i></p>

<p>Then for a few minutes there was a truce.</p>

<p>"These children," said Cousin Betty, looking at Hortense as
she went<br>
 up to her, "fancy that no one but themselves can have
lovers."</p>

<p>"Listen," Hortense replied, finding herself alone with her
cousin, "if<br>
 you prove to me that Wenceslas is not a pure invention, I will
give<br>
 you my yellow cashmere shawl."</p>

<p>"He is a Count."</p>

<p>"Every Pole is a Count!"</p>

<p>"But he is not a Pole; he comes from Liva--Litha----"</p>

<p>"Lithuania?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Livonia?"</p>

<p>"Yes, that's it!"</p>

<p>"But what is his name?"</p>

<p>"I wonder if you are capable of keeping a secret."</p>

<p>"Cousin Betty, I will be as mute!----"</p>

<p>"As a fish?"</p>

<p>"As a fish."</p>

<p>"By your life eternal?"</p>

<p>"By my life eternal!"</p>

<p>"No, by your happiness in this world?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Well, then, his name is Wenceslas Steinbock."</p>

<p>"One of Charles XII.'s Generals was named Steinbock."</p>

<p>"He was his grand-uncle. His own father settled in Livonia
after the<br>
 death of the King of Sweden; but he lost all his fortune during
the<br>
 campaign of 1812, and died, leaving the poor boy at the age of
eight<br>
 without a penny. The Grand Duke Constantine, for the honor of
the name<br>
 of Steinbock, took him under his protection and sent him to
school."</p>

<p>"I will not break my word," Hortense replied; "prove his
existence,<br>
 and you shall have the yellow shawl. The color is most becoming
to<br>
 dark skins."</p>

<p>"And you will keep my secret?"</p>

<p>"And tell you mine."</p>

<p>"Well, then, the next time I come you shall have the
proof."</p>

<p>"But the proof will be the lover," said Hortense.</p>

<p>Cousin Betty, who, since her first arrival in Paris, had been
bitten<br>
 by a mania for shawls, was bewitched by the idea of owning the
yellow<br>
 cashmere given to his wife by the Baron in 1808, and handed down
from<br>
 mother to daughter after the manner of some families in 1830.
The<br>
 shawl had been a good deal worn ten years ago; but the costly
object,<br>
 now always kept in its sandal-wood box, seemed to the old maid
ever<br>
 new, like the drawing-room furniture. So she brought in her
handbag a<br>
 present for the Baroness' birthday, by which she proposed to
prove the<br>
 existence of her romantic lover.</p>

<p><br>
 This present was a silver seal formed of three little figures
back to<br>
 back, wreathed with foliage, and supporting the Globe. They<br>
 represented Faith, Hope, and Charity; their feet rested on
monsters<br>
 rending each other, among them the symbolical serpent. In 1846,
now<br>
 that such immense strides have been made in the art of which
Benvenuto<br>
 Cellini was the master, by Mademoiselle de Fauveau, Wagner,
Jeanest,<br>
 Froment-Meurice, and wood-carvers like Lienard, this little<br>
 masterpiece would amaze nobody; but at that time a girl who
understood<br>
 the silversmith's art stood astonished as she held the seal
which<br>
 Lisbeth put into her hands, saying:</p>

<p>"There! what do you think of that?"</p>

<p>In design, attitude, and drapery the figures were of the
school of<br>
 Raphael; but the execution was in the style of the Florentine
metal<br>
 workers--the school created by Donatello, Brunelleschi,
Ghiberti,<br>
 Benvenuto Cellini, John of Bologna, and others. The French
masters of<br>
 the Renaissance had never invented more strangely twining
monsters<br>
 than these that symbolized the evil passions. The palms, ferns,
reeds,<br>
 and foliage that wreathed the Virtues showed a style, a taste,
a<br>
 handling that might have driven a practised craftsman to
despair; a<br>
 scroll floated above the three figures; and on its surface,
between<br>
 the heads, were a W, a chamois, and the word <i>fecit</i>.</p>

<p>"Who carved this?" asked Hortense.</p>

<p>"Well, just my lover," replied Lisbeth. "There are ten months'
work in<br>
 it; I could earn more at making sword-knots.--He told me
that<br>
 Steinbock means a rock goat, a chamois, in German. And he
intends to<br>
 mark all his work in that way.--Ah, ha! I shall have the
shawl."</p>

<p>"What for?"</p>

<p>"Do you suppose I could buy such a thing, or order it?
Impossible!<br>
 Well, then, it must have been given to me. And who would make me
such<br>
 a present? A lover!"</p>

<p>Hortense, with an artfulness that would have frightened
Lisbeth<br>
 Fischer if she had detected it, took care not to express all
her<br>
 admiration, though she was full of the delight which every soul
that<br>
 is open to a sense of beauty must feel on seeing a faultless
piece of<br>
 work--perfect and unexpected.</p>

<p>"On my word," said she, "it is very pretty."</p>

<p>"Yes, it is pretty," said her cousin; "but I like an
orange-colored<br>
 shawl better.--Well, child, my lover spends his time in doing
such<br>
 work as that. Since he came to Paris he has turned out three or
four<br>
 little trifles in that style, and that is the fruit of four
years'<br>
 study and toil. He has served as apprentice to founders,
metal-<br>
 casters, and goldsmiths.--There he has paid away thousands
and<br>
 hundreds of francs. And my gentleman tells me that in a few
months now<br>
 he will be famous and rich----"</p>

<p>"Then you often see him?"</p>

<p>"Bless me, do you think it is all a fable? I told you truth in
jest."</p>

<p>"And he is in love with you?" asked Hortense eagerly.</p>

<p>"He adores me," replied Lisbeth very seriously. "You see,
child, he<br>
 had never seen any women but the washed out, pale things they
all are<br>
 in the north, and a slender, brown, youthful thing like me
warmed his<br>
 heart.--But, mum; you promised, you know!"</p>

<p>"And he will fare like the five others," said the girl
ironically, as<br>
 she looked at the seal.</p>

<p>"Six others, miss. I left one in Lorraine, who, to this day,
would<br>
 fetch the moon down for me."</p>

<p>"This one does better than that," said Hortense; "he has
brought down<br>
 the sun."</p>

<p>"Where can that be turned into money?" asked her cousin. "It
takes<br>
 wide lands to benefit by the sunshine."</p>

<p>These witticisms, fired in quick retort, and leading to the
sort of<br>
 giddy play that may be imagined, had given cause for the
laughter<br>
 which had added to the Baroness' troubles by making her compare
her<br>
 daughter's future lot with the present, when she was free to
indulge<br>
 the light-heartedness of youth.</p>

<p>"But to give you a gem which cost him six months of work, he
must be<br>
 under some great obligations to you?" said Hortense, in whom
the<br>
 silver seal had suggested very serious reflections.</p>

<p>"Oh, you want to know too much at once!" said her cousin.
"But,<br>
 listen, I will let you into a little plot."</p>

<p>"Is your lover in it too?"</p>

<p>"Oh, ho! you want so much to see him! But, as you may suppose,
an old<br>
 maid like Cousin Betty, who had managed to keep a lover for
five<br>
 years, keeps him well hidden.--Now, just let me alone. You see,
I have<br>
 neither cat nor canary, neither dog nor a parrot, and the old
Nanny<br>
 Goat wanted something to pet and tease--so I treated myself to
a<br>
 Polish Count."</p>

<p>"Has he a moustache?"</p>

<p>"As long as that," said Lisbeth, holding up her shuttle filled
with<br>
 gold thread. She always took her lace-work with her, and worked
till<br>
 dinner was served.</p>

<p>"If you ask too many questions, you will be told nothing," she
went<br>
 on. "You are but two-and-twenty, and you chatter more than I do
though<br>
 I am forty-two--not to say forty-three."</p>

<p>"I am listening; I am a wooden image," said Hortense.</p>

<p>"My lover has finished a bronze group ten inches high,"
Lisbeth went<br>
 on. "It represents Samson slaying a lion, and he has kept it
buried<br>
 till it is so rusty that you might believe it to be as old as
Samson<br>
 himself. This fine piece is shown at the shop of one of the
old<br>
 curiosity sellers on the Place du Carrousel, near my lodgings.
Now,<br>
 your father knows Monsieur Popinot, the Minister of Commerce
and<br>
 Agriculture, and the Comte de Rastignac, and if he would mention
the<br>
 group to them as a fine antique he had seen by chance! It seems
that<br>
 such things take the fancy of your grand folks, who don't care
so much<br>
 about gold lace, and that my man's fortune would be made if one
of<br>
 them would buy or even look at the wretched piece of metal. The
poor<br>
 fellow is sure that it might be mistaken for old work, and that
the<br>
 rubbish is worth a great deal of money. And then, if one of
the<br>
 ministers should purchase the group, he would go to pay his
respects,<br>
 and prove that he was the maker, and be almost carried in
triumph! Oh!<br>
 he believes he has reached the pinnacle; poor young man, and he
is as<br>
 proud as two newly-made Counts."</p>

<p>"Michael Angelo over again; but, for a lover, he has kept his
head on<br>
 his shoulders!" said Hortense. "And how much does he want for
it?"</p>

<p>"Fifteen hundred francs. The dealer will not let it go for
less, since<br>
 he must take his commission."</p>

<p>"Papa is in the King's household just now," said Hortense. "He
sees<br>
 those two ministers every day at the Chamber, and he will do the
thing<br>
 --I undertake that. You will be a rich woman, Madame la Comtesse
de<br>
 Steinbock."</p>

<p>"No, the boy is too lazy; for whole weeks he sits twiddling
with bits<br>
 of red wax, and nothing comes of it. Why, he spends all his days
at<br>
 the Louvre and the Library, looking at prints and sketching
things. He<br>
 is an idler!"</p>

<p>The cousins chatted and giggled; Hortense laughing a forced
laugh, for<br>
 she was invaded by a kind of love which every girl has gone
through--<br>
 the love of the unknown, love in its vaguest form, when every
thought<br>
 is accreted round some form which is suggested by a chance word,
as<br>
 the efflorescence of hoar-frost gathers about a straw that the
wind<br>
 has blown against the window-sill.</p>

<p>For the past ten months she had made a reality of her
cousin's<br>
 imaginary romance, believing, like her mother, that Lisbeth
would<br>
 never marry; and now, within a week, this visionary being had
become<br>
 Comte Wenceslas Steinbock, the dream had a certificate of birth,
the<br>
 wraith had solidified into a young man of thirty. The seal she
held in<br>
 her hand--a sort of Annunciation in which genius shone like
an<br>
 immanent light--had the powers of a talisman. Hortense felt such
a<br>
 surge of happiness, that she almost doubted whether the tale
were<br>
 true; there was a ferment in her blood, and she laughed wildly
to<br>
 deceive her cousin.</p>

<p><br>
 "But I think the drawing-room door is open," said Lisbeth; "let
us go<br>
 and see if Monsieur Crevel is gone."</p>

<p>"Mamma has been very much out of spirits these two days. I
suppose the<br>
 marriage under discussion has come to nothing!"</p>

<p>"Oh, it may come on again. He is--I may tell you so much--a
Councillor<br>
 of the Supreme Court. How would you like to be Madame la
Presidente?<br>
 If Monsieur Crevel has a finger in it, he will tell me about it
if I<br>
 ask him. I shall know by to-morrow if there is any hope."</p>

<p>"Leave the seal with me," said Hortense; "I will not show
it--mamma's<br>
 birthday is not for a month yet; I will give it to you that
morning."</p>

<p>"No, no. Give it back to me; it must have a case."</p>

<p>"But I will let papa see it, that he may know what he is
talking about<br>
 to the ministers, for men in authority must be careful what they
say,"<br>
 urged the girl.</p>

<p>"Well, do not show it to your mother--that is all I ask; for
if she<br>
 believed I had a lover, she would make game of me."</p>

<p>"I promise."</p>

<p>The cousins reached the drawing-room just as the Baroness
turned<br>
 faint. Her daughter's cry of alarm recalled her to herself.
Lisbeth<br>
 went off to fetch some salts. When she came back, she found the
mother<br>
 and daughter in each other's arms, the Baroness soothing her<br>
 daughter's fears, and saying:</p>

<p>"It was nothing; a little nervous attack.--There is your
father," she<br>
 added, recognizing the Baron's way of ringing the bell. "Say not
a<br>
 word to him."</p>

<p>Adeline rose and went to meet her husband, intending to take
him into<br>
 the garden and talk to him till dinner should be served of
the<br>
 difficulties about the proposed match, getting him to come to
some<br>
 decision as to the future, and trying to hint at some warning
advice.</p>

<p>Baron Hector Hulot came in, in a dress at once lawyer-like
and<br>
 Napoleonic, for Imperial men--men who had been attached to the
Emperor<br>
 --were easily distinguishable by their military deportment,
their blue<br>
 coats with gilt buttons, buttoned to the chin, their black silk
stock,<br>
 and an authoritative demeanor acquired from a habit of command
in<br>
 circumstances requiring despotic rapidity. There was nothing of
the<br>
 old man in the Baron, it must be admitted; his sight was still
so<br>
 good, that he could read without spectacles; his handsome oval
face,<br>
 framed in whiskers that were indeed too black, showed a
brilliant<br>
 complexion, ruddy with the veins that characterize a
sanguine<br>
 temperament; and his stomach, kept in order by a belt, had
not<br>
 exceeded the limits of "the majestic," as Brillat-Savarin says.
A fine<br>
 aristocratic air and great affability served to conceal the
libertine<br>
 with whom Crevel had had such high times. He was one of those
men<br>
 whose eyes always light up at the sight of a pretty woman, even
of<br>
 such as merely pass by, never to be seen again.</p>

<p>"Have you been speaking, my dear?" asked Adeline, seeing him
with an<br>
 anxious brow.</p>

<p>"No," replied Hector, "but I am worn out with hearing others
speak for<br>
 two hours without coming to a vote. They carry on a war of
words, in<br>
 which their speeches are like a cavalry charge which has no
effect on<br>
 the enemy. Talk has taken the place of action, which goes very
much<br>
 against the grain with men who are accustomed to marching
orders, as I<br>
 said to the Marshal when I left him. However, I have enough of
being<br>
 bored on the ministers' bench; here I may play.--How do, la
Chevre!--<br>
 Good morning, little kid," and he took his daughter round the
neck,<br>
 kissed her, and made her sit on his knee, resting her head on
his<br>
 shoulder, that he might feel her soft golden hair against his
cheek.</p>

<p>"He is tired and worried," said his wife to herself. "I shall
only<br>
 worry him more.--I will wait.--Are you going to be at home
this<br>
 evening?" she asked him.</p>

<p>"No, children. After dinner I must go out. If it had not been
the day<br>
 when Lisbeth and the children and my brother come to dinner, you
would<br>
 not have seen me at all."</p>

<p>The Baroness took up the newspaper, looked down the list of
theatres,<br>
 and laid it down again when she had seen that Robert <i>le
Diable</i> was<br>
 to be given at the Opera. Josepha, who had left the Italian
Opera six<br>
 months since for the French Opera, was to take the part of
Alice.</p>

<p>This little pantomime did not escape the Baron, who looked
hard at his<br>
 wife. Adeline cast down her eyes and went out into the garden;
her<br>
 husband followed her.</p>

<p>"Come, what is it, Adeline?" said he, putting his arm round
her waist<br>
 and pressing her to his side. "Do not you know that I love you
more<br>
 than----"</p>

<p>"More than Jenny Cadine or Josepha!" said she, boldly
interrupting<br>
 him.</p>

<p>"Who put that into your head?" exclaimed the Baron, releasing
his<br>
 wife, and starting back a step or two.</p>

<p>"I got an anonymous letter, which I burnt at once, in which I
was<br>
 told, my dear, that the reason Hortense's marriage was broken
off was<br>
 the poverty of our circumstances. Your wife, my dear Hector,
would<br>
 never have said a word; she knew of your connection with Jenny
Cadine,<br>
 and did she ever complain?--But as the mother of Hortense, I am
bound<br>
 to speak the truth."</p>

<p>Hulot, after a short silence, which was terrible to his wife,
whose<br>
 heart beat loud enough to be heard, opened his arms, clasped her
to<br>
 his heart, kissed her forehead, and said with the vehemence
of<br>
 enthusiasm:</p>

<p>"Adeline, you are an angel, and I am a wretch----"</p>

<p>"No, no," cried the Baroness, hastily laying her hand upon his
lips to<br>
 hinder him from speaking evil of himself.</p>

<p>"Yes, for I have not at this moment a sou to give to Hortense,
and I<br>
 am most unhappy. But since you open your heart to me, I may pour
into<br>
 it the trouble that is crushing me.--Your Uncle Fischer is
in<br>
 difficulties, and it is I who dragged him there, for he has
accepted<br>
 bills for me to the amount of twenty-five thousand francs! And
all for<br>
 a woman who deceives me, who laughs at me behind my back, and
calls me<br>
 an old dyed Tom. It is frightful! A vice which costs me more
than it<br>
 would to maintain a family!--And I cannot resist!--I would
promise you<br>
 here and now never to see that abominable Jewess again; but if
she<br>
 wrote me two lines, I should go to her, as we marched into fire
under<br>
 the Emperor."</p>

<p>"Do not be so distressed," cried the poor woman in despair,
but<br>
 forgetting her daughter as she saw the tears in her husband's
eyes.<br>
 "There are my diamonds; whatever happens, save my uncle."</p>

<p>"Your diamonds are worth scarcely twenty thousand francs
nowadays.<br>
 That would not be enough for old Fischer, so keep them for
Hortense; I<br>
 will see the Marshal to-morrow."</p>

<p>"My poor dear!" said the Baroness, taking her Hector's hands
and<br>
 kissing them.</p>

<p>This was all the scolding he got. Adeline sacrificed her
jewels, the<br>
 father made them a present to Hortense, she regarded this as a
sublime<br>
 action, and she was helpless.</p>

<p>"He is the master; he could take everything, and he leaves me
my<br>
 diamonds; he is divine!"</p>

<p>This was the current of her thoughts; and indeed the wife had
gained<br>
 more by her sweetness than another perhaps could have achieved
by a<br>
 fit of angry jealousy.</p>

<p>The moralist cannot deny that, as a rule, well-bred though
very wicked<br>
 men are far more attractive and lovable than virtuous men;
having<br>
 crimes to atone for, they crave indulgence by anticipation, by
being<br>
 lenient to the shortcomings of those who judge them, and they
are<br>
 thought most kind. Though there are no doubt some charming
people<br>
 among the virtuous, Virtue considers itself fair enough,
unadorned, to<br>
 be at no pains to please; and then all really virtuous persons,
for<br>
 the hypocrites do not count, have some slight doubts as to
their<br>
 position; they believe that they are cheated in the bargain of
life on<br>
 the whole, and they indulge in acid comments after the fashion
of<br>
 those who think themselves unappreciated.</p>

<p>Hence the Baron, who accused himself of ruining his family,
displayed<br>
 all his charm of wit and his most seductive graces for the
benefit of<br>
 his wife, for his children, and his Cousin Lisbeth.</p>

<p>Then, when his son arrived with Celestine, Crevel's daughter,
who was<br>
 nursing the infant Hulot, he was delightful to his
daughter-in-law,<br>
 loading her with compliments--a treat to which Celestine's
vanity was<br>
 little accustomed for no moneyed bride more commonplace or
more<br>
 utterly insignificant was ever seen. The grandfather took the
baby<br>
 from her, kissed it, declared it was a beauty and a darling; he
spoke<br>
 to it in baby language, prophesied that it would grow to be
taller<br>
 than himself, insinuated compliments for his son's benefit,
and<br>
 restored the child to the Normandy nurse who had charge of
it.<br>
 Celestine, on her part, gave the Baroness a look, as much as to
say,<br>
 "What a delightful man!" and she naturally took her
father-in-law's<br>
 part against her father.</p>

<p>After thus playing the charming father-in-law and the
indulgent<br>
 grandpapa, the Baron took his son into the garden, and laid
before him<br>
 a variety of observations full of good sense as to the attitude
to be<br>
 taken up by the Chamber on a certain ticklish question which had
that<br>
 morning come under discussion. The young lawyer was struck
with<br>
 admiration for the depth of his father's insight, touched by
his<br>
 cordiality, and especially by the deferential tone which seemed
to<br>
 place the two men on a footing of equality.</p>

<p>Monsieur Hulot <i>junior</i> was in every respect the young
Frenchman, as<br>
 he has been moulded by the Revolution of 1830; his mind
infatuated<br>
 with politics, respectful of his own hopes, and concealing them
under<br>
 an affectation of gravity, very envious of successful men,
making<br>
 sententiousness do the duty of witty rejoinders--the gems of
the<br>
 French language--with a high sense of importance, and
mistaking<br>
 arrogance for dignity.</p>

<p>Such men are walking coffins, each containing a Frenchman of
the past;<br>
 now and again the Frenchman wakes up and kicks against his
English-<br>
 made casing; but ambition stifles him, and he submits to be
smothered.<br>
 The coffin is always covered with black cloth.</p>

<p>"Ah, here is my brother!" said Baron Hulot, going to meet the
Count at<br>
 the drawing-room door.</p>

<p>Having greeted the probable successor of the late Marshal
Montcornet,<br>
 he led him forward by the arm with every show of affection
and<br>
 respect.</p>

<p>The older man, a member of the Chamber of Peers, but excused
from<br>
 attendance on account of his deafness, had a handsome head,
chilled by<br>
 age, but with enough gray hair still to be marked in a circle by
the<br>
 pressure of his hat. He was short, square, and shrunken, but
carried<br>
 his hale old age with a free-and-easy air; and as he was full
of<br>
 excessive activity, which had now no purpose, he divided his
time<br>
 between reading and taking exercise. In a drawing-room he
devoted his<br>
 attention to waiting on the wishes of the ladies.</p>

<p>"You are very merry here," said he, seeing that the Baron shed
a<br>
 spirit of animation on the little family gathering. "And yet
Hortense<br>
 is not married," he added, noticing a trace of melancholy on
his<br>
 sister-in-law's countenance.</p>

<p>"That will come all in good time," Lisbeth shouted in his ear
in a<br>
 formidable voice.</p>

<p>"So there you are, you wretched seedling that could never
blossom,"<br>
 said he, laughing.</p>

<p>The hero of Forzheim rather liked Cousin Betty, for there were
certain<br>
 points of resemblance between them. A man of the ranks, without
any<br>
 education, his courage had been the sole mainspring of his
military<br>
 promotion, and sound sense had taken the place of brilliancy. Of
the<br>
 highest honor and clean-handed, he was ending a noble life in
full<br>
 contentment in the centre of his family, which claimed all
his<br>
 affections, and without a suspicion of his brother's still<br>
 undiscovered misconduct. No one enjoyed more than he the
pleasing<br>
 sight of this family party, where there never was the
smallest<br>
 disagreement, for the brothers and sisters were all equally
attached,<br>
 Celestine having been at once accepted as one of the family. But
the<br>
 worthy little Count wondered now and then why Monsieur Crevel
never<br>
 joined the party. "Papa is in the country," Celestine shouted,
and it<br>
 was explained to him that the ex-perfumer was away from
home.</p>

<p>This perfect union of all her family made Madame Hulot say to
herself,<br>
 "This, after all, is the best kind of happiness, and who can
deprive<br>
 us of it?"</p>

<p>The General, on seeing his favorite Adeline the object of
her<br>
 husband's attentions, laughed so much about it that the Baron,
fearing<br>
 to seem ridiculous, transferred his gallantries to his
daughter-in-<br>
 law, who at these family dinners was always the object of his
flattery<br>
 and kind care, for he hoped to win Crevel back through her, and
make<br>
 him forego his resentment.</p>

<p>Any one seeing this domestic scene would have found it hard to
believe<br>
 that the father was at his wits' end, the mother in despair, the
son<br>
 anxious beyond words as to his father's future fate, and the
daughter<br>
 on the point of robbing her cousin of her lover.</p>

<p>At seven o'clock the Baron, seeing his brother, his son, the
Baroness,<br>
 and Hortense all engaged at whist, went off to applaud his
mistress at<br>
 the Opera, taking with him Lisbeth Fischer, who lived in the Rue
du<br>
 Doyenne, and who always made an excuse of the solitude of
that<br>
 deserted quarter to take herself off as soon as dinner was
over.<br>
 Parisians will all admit that the old maid's prudence was
but<br>
 rational.</p>

<p>The existence of the maze of houses under the wing of the old
Louvre<br>
 is one of those protests against obvious good sense which
Frenchmen<br>
 love, that Europe may reassure itself as to the quantum of
brains they<br>
 are known to have, and not be too much alarmed. Perhaps
without<br>
 knowing it, this reveals some profound political idea.</p>

<p>It will surely not be a work of supererogation to describe
this part<br>
 of Paris as it is even now, when we could hardly expect its
survival;<br>
 and our grandsons, who will no doubt see the Louvre finished,
may<br>
 refuse to believe that such a relic of barbarism should have
survived<br>
 for six-and-thirty years in the heart of Paris and in the face
of the<br>
 palace where three dynasties of kings have received, during
those<br>
 thirty-six years, the elite of France and of Europe.</p>

<p>Between the little gate leading to the Bridge of the Carrousel
and the<br>
 Rue du Musee, every one having come to Paris, were it but for a
few<br>
 days, must have seen a dozen of houses with a decayed frontage
where<br>
 the dejected owners have attempted no repairs, the remains of an
old<br>
 block of buildings of which the destruction was begun at the
time when<br>
 Napoleon determined to complete the Louvre. This street, and the
blind<br>
 alley known as the Impasse du Doyenne, are the only passages
into this<br>
 gloomy and forsaken block, inhabited perhaps by ghosts, for
there<br>
 never is anybody to be seen. The pavement is much below the
footway of<br>
 the Rue du Musee, on a level with that of the Rue Froidmanteau.
Thus,<br>
 half sunken by the raising of the soil, these houses are also
wrapped<br>
 in the perpetual shadow cast by the lofty buildings of the
Louvre,<br>
 darkened on that side by the northern blast. Darkness, silence,
an icy<br>
 chill, and the cavernous depth of the soil combine to make
these<br>
 houses a kind of crypt, tombs of the living. As we drive in a
hackney<br>
 cab past this dead-alive spot, and chance to look down the
little Rue<br>
 du Doyenne, a shudder freezes the soul, and we wonder who can
lie<br>
 there, and what things may be done there at night, at an hour
when the<br>
 alley is a cut-throat pit, and the vices of Paris run riot there
under<br>
 the cloak of night. This question, frightful in itself,
becomes<br>
 appalling when we note that these dwelling-houses are shut in on
the<br>
 side towards the Rue de Richelieu by marshy ground, by a sea
of<br>
 tumbled paving-stones between them and the Tuileries, by
little<br>
 garden-plots and suspicious-looking hovels on the side of the
great<br>
 galleries, and by a desert of building-stone and old rubbish on
the<br>
 side towards the old Louvre. Henri III. and his favorites in
search of<br>
 their trunk-hose, and Marguerite's lovers in search of their
heads,<br>
 must dance sarabands by moonlight in this wilderness overlooked
by the<br>
 roof of a chapel still standing there as if to prove that the
Catholic<br>
 religion--so deeply rooted in France--survives all else.</p>

<p><br>
 For forty years now has the Louvre been crying out by every gap
in<br>
 these damaged walls, by every yawning window, "Rid me of these
warts<br>
 upon my face!" This cutthroat lane has no doubt been regarded
as<br>
 useful, and has been thought necessary as symbolizing in the
heart of<br>
 Paris the intimate connection between poverty and the splendor
that is<br>
 characteristic of the queen of cities. And indeed these chill
ruins,<br>
 among which the Legitimist newspaper contracted the disease it
is<br>
 dying of--the abominable hovels of the Rue du Musee, and the
hoarding<br>
 appropriated by the shop stalls that flourish there--will
perhaps live<br>
 longer and more prosperously than three successive
dynasties.</p>

<p>In 1823 the low rents in these already condemned houses had
tempted<br>
 Lisbeth Fischer to settle there, notwithstanding the necessity
imposed<br>
 upon her by the state of the neighborhood to get home before<br>
 nightfall. This necessity, however, was in accordance with the
country<br>
 habits she retained, of rising and going to bed with the sun,
an<br>
 arrangement which saves country folk considerable sums in lights
and<br>
 fuel. She lived in one of the houses which, since the demolition
of<br>
 the famous Hotel Cambaceres, command a view of the square.</p>

<p>Just as Baron Hulot set his wife's cousin down at the door of
this<br>
 house, saying, "Good-night, Cousin," an elegant-looking woman,
young,<br>
 small, slender, pretty, beautifully dressed, and redolent of
some<br>
 delicate perfume, passed between the wall and the carriage to go
in.<br>
 This lady, without any premeditation, glanced up at the Baron
merely<br>
 to see the lodger's cousin, and the libertine at once felt the
swift<br>
 impression which all Parisians know on meeting a pretty
woman,<br>
 realizing, as entomologists have it, their <i>desiderata</i>; so
he waited<br>
 to put on one of his gloves with judicious deliberation before
getting<br>
 into the carriage again, to give himself an excuse for allowing
his<br>
 eye to follow the young woman, whose skirts were pleasingly set
out by<br>
 something else than these odious and delusive crinoline
bustles.</p>

<p>"That," said he to himself, "is a nice little person whose
happiness I<br>
 should like to provide for, as she would certainly secure
mine."</p>

<p>When the unknown fair had gone into the hall at the foot of
the stairs<br>
 going up to the front rooms, she glanced at the gate out of the
corner<br>
 of her eye without precisely looking round, and she could see
the<br>
 Baron riveted to the spot in admiration, consumed by curiosity
and<br>
 desire. This is to every Parisian woman a sort of flower which
she<br>
 smells at with delight, if she meets it on her way. Nay,
certain<br>
 women, though faithful to their duties, pretty, and virtuous,
come<br>
 home much put out if they have failed to cull such a posy in
the<br>
 course of their walk.</p>

<p>The lady ran upstairs, and in a moment a window on the second
floor<br>
 was thrown open, and she appeared at it, but accompanied by a
man<br>
 whose baldhead and somewhat scowling looks announced him as
her<br>
 husband.</p>

<p>"If they aren't sharp and ingenious, the cunning jades!"
thought the<br>
 Baron. "She does that to show me where she lives. But this is
getting<br>
 rather warm, especially for this part of Paris. We must mind
what we<br>
 are at."</p>

<p>As he got into the <i>milord</i>, he looked up, and the lady
and the<br>
 husband hastily vanished, as though the Baron's face had
affected them<br>
 like the mythological head of Medusa.</p>

<p>"It would seem that they know me," thought the Baron. "That
would<br>
 account for everything."</p>

<p>As the carriage went up the Rue du Musee, he leaned forward to
see the<br>
 lady again, and in fact she was again at the window. Ashamed of
being<br>
 caught gazing at the hood under which her admirer was sitting,
the<br>
 unknown started back at once.</p>

<p>"Nanny shall tell me who it is," said the Baron to
himself.</p>

<p>The sight of the Government official had, as will be seen,
made a deep<br>
 impression on this couple.</p>

<p>"Why, it is Baron Hulot, the chief of the department to which
my<br>
 office belongs!" exclaimed the husband as he left the
window.</p>

<p>"Well, Marneffe, the old maid on the third floor at the back
of the<br>
 courtyard, who lives with that young man, is his cousin. Is it
not odd<br>
 that we should never have known that till to-day, and now find
it out<br>
 by chance?"</p>

<p>"Mademoiselle Fischer living with a young man?" repeated the
husband.<br>
 "That is porter's gossip; do not speak so lightly of the cousin
of a<br>
 Councillor of State who can blow hot and cold in the office as
he<br>
 pleases. Now, come to dinner; I have been waiting for you since
four<br>
 o'clock."</p>

<p>Pretty--very pretty--Madame Marneffe, the natural daughter of
Comte<br>
 Montcornet, one of Napoleon's most famous officers, had, on
the<br>
 strength of a marriage portion of twenty thousand francs, found
a<br>
 husband in an inferior official at the War Office. Through
the<br>
 interest of the famous lieutenant-general--made marshal of
France six<br>
 months before his death--this quill-driver had risen to
unhoped-for<br>
 dignity as head-clerk of his office; but just as he was to be
promoted<br>
 to be deputy-chief, the marshal's death had cut off
Marneffe's<br>
 ambitions and his wife's at the root. The very small salary
enjoyed by<br>
 Sieur Marneffe had compelled the couple to economize in the
matter of<br>
 rent; for in his hands Mademoiselle Valerie Fortin's fortune
had<br>
 already melted away--partly in paying his debts, and partly in
the<br>
 purchase of necessaries for furnishing a house, but chiefly
in<br>
 gratifying the requirements of a pretty young wife, accustomed
in her<br>
 mother's house to luxuries she did not choose to dispense with.
The<br>
 situation of the Rue du Doyenne, within easy distance of the
War<br>
 Office, and the gay part of Paris, smiled on Monsieur and
Madame<br>
 Marneffe, and for the last four years they had dwelt under the
same<br>
 roof as Lisbeth Fischer.</p>

<p>Monsieur Jean-Paul-Stanislas Marneffe was one of the class of
employes<br>
 who escape sheer brutishness by the kind of power that comes
of<br>
 depravity. The small, lean creature, with thin hair and a
starved<br>
 beard, an unwholesome pasty face, worn rather than wrinkled,
with red-<br>
 lidded eyes harnessed with spectacles, shuffling in his gait,
and yet<br>
 meaner in his appearance, realized the type of man that any one
would<br>
 conceive of as likely to be placed in the dock for an offence
against<br>
 decency.</p>

<p>The rooms inhabited by this couple had the illusory appearance
of sham<br>
 luxury seen in many Paris homes, and typical of a certain class
of<br>
 household. In the drawing-room, the furniture covered with
shabby<br>
 cotton velvet, the plaster statuettes pretending to be
Florentine<br>
 bronze, the clumsy cast chandelier merely lacquered, with cheap
glass<br>
 saucers, the carpet, whose small cost was accounted for in
advancing<br>
 life by the quality of cotton used in the manufacture, now
visible to<br>
 the naked eye,--everything, down to the curtains, which plainly
showed<br>
 that worsted damask has not three years of prime, proclaimed
poverty<br>
 as loudly as a beggar in rags at a church door.</p>

<p>The dining-room, badly kept by a single servant, had the
sickening<br>
 aspect of a country inn; everything looked greasy and
unclean.</p>

<p>Monsieur's room, very like a schoolboy's, furnished with the
bed and<br>
 fittings remaining from his bachelor days, as shabby and worn as
he<br>
 was, dusted perhaps once a week--that horrible room where
everything<br>
 was in a litter, with old socks hanging over the
horsehair-seated<br>
 chairs, the pattern outlined in dust, was that of a man to whom
home<br>
 is a matter of indifference, who lives out of doors, gambling in
cafes<br>
 or elsewhere.</p>

<p>Madame's room was an exception to the squalid slovenliness
that<br>
 disgraced the living rooms, where the curtains were yellow with
smoke<br>
 and dust, and where the child, evidently left to himself,
littered<br>
 every spot with his toys. Valerie's room and dressing-room
were<br>
 situated in the part of the house which, on one side of the
courtyard,<br>
 joined the front half, looking out on the street, to the wing
forming<br>
 the inner side of the court backing against the adjoining
property.<br>
 Handsomely hung with chintz, furnished with rosewood, and
thickly<br>
 carpeted, they proclaimed themselves as belonging to a pretty
woman--<br>
 and indeed suggested the kept mistress. A clock in the
fashionable<br>
 style stood on the velvet-covered mantelpiece. There was a
nicely<br>
 fitted cabinet, and the Chinese flower-stands were handsomely
filled.<br>
 The bed, the toilet-table, the wardrobe with its mirror, the
little<br>
 sofa, and all the lady's frippery bore the stamp of fashion
or<br>
 caprice. Though everything was quite third-rate as to elegance
or<br>
 quality, and nothing was absolutely newer than three years old,
a<br>
 dandy would have had no fault to find but that the taste of all
this<br>
 luxury was commonplace. Art, and the distinction that comes of
the<br>
 choice of things that taste assimilates, was entirely wanting.
A<br>
 doctor of social science would have detected a lover in two or
three<br>
 specimens of costly trumpery, which could only have come there
through<br>
 that demi-god--always absent, but always present if the lady
is<br>
 married.</p>

<p><br>
 The dinner, four hours behind time, to which the husband, wife,
and<br>
 child sat down, betrayed the financial straits in which the
household<br>
 found itself, for the table is the surest thermometer for
gauging the<br>
 income of a Parisian family. Vegetable soup made with the
water<br>
 haricot beans had been boiled in, a piece of stewed veal and
potatoes<br>
 sodden with water by way of gravy, a dish of haricot beans, and
cheap<br>
 cherries, served and eaten in cracked plates and dishes, with
the<br>
 dull-looking and dull-sounding forks of German silver--was this
a<br>
 banquet worthy of this pretty young woman? The Baron would have
wept<br>
 could he have seen it. The dingy decanters could not disguise
the vile<br>
 hue of wine bought by the pint at the nearest wineshop. The
table-<br>
 napkins had seen a week's use. In short, everything betrayed<br>
 undignified penury, and the equal indifference of the husband
and wife<br>
 to the decencies of home. The most superficial observer on
seeing them<br>
 would have said that these two beings had come to the stage when
the<br>
 necessity of living had prepared them for any kind of dishonor
that<br>
 might bring luck to them. Valerie's first words to her husband
will<br>
 explain the delay that had postponed the dinner by the not<br>
 disinterested devotion of the cook.</p>

<p>"Samanon will only take your bills at fifty per cent, and
insists on a<br>
 lien on your salary as security."</p>

<p>So poverty, still unconfessed in the house of the superior
official,<br>
 and hidden under a stipend of twenty-four thousand francs,<br>
 irrespective of presents, had reached its lowest stage in that
of the<br>
 clerk.</p>

<p>"You have caught on with the chief," said the man, looking at
his<br>
 wife.</p>

<p>"I rather think so," replied she, understanding the full
meaning of<br>
 his slang expression.</p>

<p>"What is to become of us?" Marneffe went on. "The landlord
will be<br>
 down on us to-morrow. And to think of your father dying without
making<br>
 a will! On my honor, those men of the Empire all think
themselves as<br>
 immortal as their Emperor."</p>

<p>"Poor father!" said she. "I was his only child, and he was
very fond<br>
 of me. The Countess probably burned the will. How could he
forget me<br>
 when he used to give us as much as three or four thousand-franc
notes<br>
 at once, from time to time?"</p>

<p>"We owe four quarters' rent, fifteen hundred francs. Is the
furniture<br>
 worth so much? <i>That is the question</i>, as Shakespeare
says."</p>

<p>"Now, good-bye, ducky!" said Valerie, who had only eaten a
few<br>
 mouthfuls of the veal, from which the maid had extracted all the
gravy<br>
 for a brave soldier just home from Algiers. "Great evils demand
heroic<br>
 remedies."</p>

<p>"Valerie, where are you off to?" cried Marneffe, standing
between his<br>
 wife and the door.</p>

<p>"I am going to see the landlord," she replied, arranging her
ringlets<br>
 under her smart bonnet. "You had better try to make friends with
that<br>
 old maid, if she really is your chief's cousin."</p>

<p>The ignorance in which the dwellers under one roof can exist
as to the<br>
 social position of their fellow-lodgers is a permanent fact
which, as<br>
 much as any other, shows what the rush of Paris life is. Still,
it is<br>
 easily conceivable that a clerk who goes early every morning to
his<br>
 office, comes home only to dinner, and spends every evening out,
and a<br>
 woman swallowed up in a round of pleasures, should know nothing
of an<br>
 old maid living on the third floor beyond the courtyard of the
house<br>
 they dwell in, especially when she lives as Mademoiselle Fischer
did.</p>

<p>Up in the morning before any one else, Lisbeth went out to buy
her<br>
 bread, milk, and live charcoal, never speaking to any one, and
she<br>
 went to bed with the sun; she never had a letter or a visitor,
nor<br>
 chatted with her neighbors. Here was one of those anonymous,<br>
 entomological existences such as are to be met with in many
large<br>
 tenements where, at the end of four years, you unexpectedly
learn that<br>
 up on the fourth floor there is an old man lodging who knew
Voltaire,<br>
 Pilatre de Rozier, Beaujon, Marcel, Mole, Sophie Arnould,
Franklin,<br>
 and Robespierre. What Monsieur and Madame Marneffe had just
said<br>
 concerning Lisbeth Fischer they had come to know, in
consequence,<br>
 partly, of the loneliness of the neighborhood, and of the
alliance, to<br>
 which their necessities had led, between them and the
doorkeepers,<br>
 whose goodwill was too important to them not to have been
carefully<br>
 encouraged.</p>

<p>Now, the old maid's pride, silence, and reserve had engendered
in the<br>
 porter and his wife the exaggerated respect and cold civility
which<br>
 betray the unconfessed annoyance of an inferior. Also, the
porter<br>
 thought himself in all essentials the equal of any lodger whose
rent<br>
 was no more than two hundred and fifty francs. Cousin
Betty's<br>
 confidences to Hortense were true; and it is evident that the
porter's<br>
 wife might be very likely to slander Mademoiselle Fischer in
her<br>
 intimate gossip with the Marneffes, while only intending to
tell<br>
 tales.</p>

<p>When Lisbeth had taken her candle from the hands of worthy
Madame<br>
 Olivier the portress, she looked up to see whether the windows
of the<br>
 garret over her own rooms were lighted up. At that hour, even in
July,<br>
 it was so dark within the courtyard that the old maid could not
get to<br>
 bed without a light.</p>

<p>"Oh, you may be quite easy, Monsieur Steinbock is in his room.
He has<br>
 not been out even," said Madame Olivier, with meaning.</p>

<p>Lisbeth made no reply. She was still a peasant, in so far that
she was<br>
 indifferent to the gossip of persons unconnected with her. Just
as a<br>
 peasant sees nothing beyond his village, she cared for
nobody's<br>
 opinion outside the little circle in which she lived. So she
boldly<br>
 went up, not to her own room, but to the garret; and this is
why. At<br>
 dessert she had filled her bag with fruit and sweets for her
lover,<br>
 and she went to give them to him, exactly as an old lady brings
home a<br>
 biscuit for her dog.</p>

<p>She found the hero of Hortense's dreams working by the light
of a<br>
 small lamp, of which the light was intensified by the use of a
bottle<br>
 of water as a lens--a pale young man, seated at a workman's
bench<br>
 covered with a modeler's tools, wax, chisels, rough-hewn stone,
and<br>
 bronze castings; he wore a blouse, and had in his hand a little
group<br>
 in red wax, which he gazed at like a poet absorbed in his
labors.</p>

<p>"Here, Wenceslas, see what I have brought you," said she,
laying her<br>
 handkerchief on a corner of the table; then she carefully took
the<br>
 sweetmeats and fruit out of her bag.</p>

<p>"You are very kind, mademoiselle," replied the exile in
melancholy<br>
 tones.</p>

<p>"It will do you good, poor boy. You get feverish by working so
hard;<br>
 you were not born to such a rough life."</p>

<p>Wenceslas Steinbock looked at her with a bewildered air.</p>

<p>"Eat--come, eat," said she sharply, "instead of looking at me
as you<br>
 do at one of your images when you are satisfied with it."</p>

<p>On being thus smacked with words, the young man seemed less
puzzled,<br>
 for this, indeed, was the female Mentor whose tender moods were
always<br>
 a surprise to him, so much more accustomed was he to be
scolded.</p>

<p>Though Steinbock was nine-and-twenty, like many fair men, he
looked<br>
 five or six years younger; and seeing his youth, though its
freshness<br>
 had faded under the fatigue and stress of life in exile, by the
side<br>
 of that dry, hard face, it seemed as though Nature had blundered
in<br>
 the distribution of sex. He rose and threw himself into a deep
chair<br>
 of Louis XV. pattern, covered with yellow Utrecht velvet, as if
to<br>
 rest himself. The old maid took a greengage and offered it to
him.</p>

<p>"Thank you," said he, taking the plum.</p>

<p>"Are you tired?" said she, giving him another.</p>

<p>"I am not tired with work, but tired of life," said he.</p>

<p>"What absurd notions you have!" she exclaimed with some
annoyance.<br>
 "Have you not had a good genius to keep an eye on you?" she
said,<br>
 offering him the sweetmeats, and watching him with pleasure as
he ate<br>
 them all. "You see, I thought of you when dining with my
cousin."</p>

<p>"I know," said he, with a look at Lisbeth that was at once<br>
 affectionate and plaintive, "but for you I should long since
have<br>
 ceased to live. But, my dear lady, artists require
relaxation----"</p>

<p>"Ah! there we come to the point!" cried she, interrupting him,
her<br>
 hands on her hips, and her flashing eyes fixed on him. "You want
to go<br>
 wasting your health in the vile resorts of Paris, like so
many<br>
 artisans, who end by dying in the workhouse. No, no, make a
fortune,<br>
 and then, when you have money in the funds, you may amuse
yourself,<br>
 child; then you will have enough to pay for the doctor and for
your<br>
 pleasure, libertine that you are."</p>

<p>Wenceslas Steinbock, on receiving this broadside, with an<br>
 accompaniment of looks that pierced him like a magnetic flame,
bent<br>
 his head. The most malignant slanderer on seeing this scene
would at<br>
 once have understood that the hints thrown out by the Oliviers
were<br>
 false. Everything in this couple, their tone, manner, and way
of<br>
 looking at each other, proved the purity of their private live.
The<br>
 old maid showed the affection of rough but very genuine
maternal<br>
 feeling; the young man submitted, as a respectful son yields to
the<br>
 tyranny of a mother. The strange alliance seemed to be the
outcome of<br>
 a strong will acting constantly on a weak character, on the
fluid<br>
 nature peculiar to the Slavs, which, while it does not hinder
them<br>
 from showing heroic courage in battle, gives them an amazing<br>
 incoherency of conduct, a moral softness of which physiologists
ought<br>
 to try to detect the causes, since physiologists are to
political life<br>
 what entomologists are to agriculture.</p>

<p>"But if I die before I am rich?" said Wenceslas dolefully.</p>

<p>"Die!" cried she. "Oh, I will not let you die. I have life
enough for<br>
 both, and I would have my blood injected into your veins if<br>
 necessary."</p>

<p>Tears rose to Steinbock's eyes as he heard her vehement and
artless<br>
 speech.</p>

<p>"Do not be unhappy, my little Wenceslas," said Lisbeth with
feeling.<br>
 "My cousin Hortense thought your seal quite pretty, I am sure;
and I<br>
 will manage to sell your bronze group, you will see; you will
have<br>
 paid me off, you will be able to do as you please, you will soon
be<br>
 free. Come, smile a little!"</p>

<p>"I can never repay you, mademoiselle," said the exile.</p>

<p>"And why not?" asked the peasant woman, taking the Livonian's
part<br>
 against herself.</p>

<p>"Because you not only fed me, lodged me, cared for me in my
poverty,<br>
 but you also gave me strength. You have made me what I am; you
have<br>
 often been stern, you have made me very unhappy----"</p>

<p>"I?" said the old maid. "Are you going to pour out all your
nonsense<br>
 once more about poetry and the arts, and to crack your fingers
and<br>
 stretch your arms while you spout about the ideal, and beauty,
and all<br>
 your northern madness?--Beauty is not to compare with solid
pudding--<br>
 and what am I!--You have ideas in your brain? What is the use of
them?<br>
 I too have ideas. What is the good of all the fine things you
may have<br>
 in your soul if you can make no use of them? Those who have
ideas do<br>
 not get so far as those who have none, if they don't know which
way to<br>
 go.</p>

<p>"Instead of thinking over your ideas you must work.--Now, what
have<br>
 you done while I was out?"</p>

<p>"What did your pretty cousin say?"</p>

<p>"Who told you she was pretty?" asked Lisbeth sharply, in a
tone hollow<br>
 with tiger-like jealousy.</p>

<p>"Why, you did."</p>

<p>"That was only to see your face. Do you want to go trotting
after<br>
 petticoats? You who are so fond of women, well, make them in
bronze.<br>
 Let us see a cast of your desires, for you will have to do
without the<br>
 ladies for some little time yet, and certainly without my
cousin, my<br>
 good fellow. She is not game for your bag; that young lady wants
a man<br>
 with sixty thousand francs a year--and has found him!</p>

<p>"Why, your bed is not made!" she exclaimed, looking into the
adjoining<br>
 room. "Poor dear boy, I quite forgot you!"</p>

<p>The sturdy woman pulled off her gloves, her cape and bonnet,
and<br>
 remade the artist's little camp bed as briskly as any housemaid.
This<br>
 mixture of abruptness, of roughness even, with real kindness,
perhaps<br>
 accounts for the ascendency Lisbeth had acquired over the man
whom she<br>
 regarded as her personal property. Is not our attachment to life
based<br>
 on its alternations of good and evil?</p>

<p>If the Livonian had happened to meet Madame Marneffe instead
of<br>
 Lisbeth Fischer, he would have found a protectress whose
complaisance<br>
 must have led him into some boggy or discreditable path, where
he<br>
 would have been lost. He would certainly never have worked, nor
the<br>
 artist have been hatched out. Thus, while he deplored the old
maid's<br>
 grasping avarice, his reason bid him prefer her iron hand to the
life<br>
 of idleness and peril led by many of his fellow-countrymen.</p>

<p>This was the incident that had given rise to the coalition of
female<br>
 energy and masculine feebleness--a contrast in union said not to
be<br>
 uncommon in Poland.</p>

<p>In 1833 Mademoiselle Fischer, who sometimes worked into the
night when<br>
 business was good, at about one o'clock one morning perceived a
strong<br>
 smell of carbonic acid gas, and heard the groans of a dying man.
The<br>
 fumes and the gasping came from a garret over the two rooms
forming<br>
 her dwelling, and she supposed that a young man who had but
lately<br>
 come to lodge in this attic--which had been vacant for three
years--<br>
 was committing suicide. She ran upstairs, broke in the door by a
push<br>
 with her peasant strength, and found the lodger writhing on a
camp-bed<br>
 in the convulsions of death. She extinguished the brazier; the
door<br>
 was open, the air rushed in, and the exile was saved. Then,
when<br>
 Lisbeth had put him to bed like a patient, and he was asleep,
she<br>
 could detect the motives of his suicide in the destitution of
the<br>
 rooms, where there was nothing whatever but a wretched table,
the<br>
 camp-bed, and two chairs.</p>

<p><br>
 On the table lay a document, which she read:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"I am Count Wenceslas Steinbock, born at Prelia, in
Livonia.</p>

<p>"No one is to be accused of my death; my reasons for
killing<br>
 myself are, in the words of Kosciusko, <i>Finis
Polonioe</i>!</p>

<p>"The grand-nephew of a valiant General under Charles XII.
could<br>
 not beg. My weakly constitution forbids my taking military<br>
 service, and I yesterday saw the last of the hundred thalers
which<br>
 I had brought with me from Dresden to Paris. I have left
twenty-<br>
 five francs in the drawer of this table to pay the rent I owe
to<br>
 the landlord.</p>

<p>"My parents being dead, my death will affect nobody. I desire
that<br>
 my countrymen will not blame the French Government. I have
never<br>
 registered myself as a refugee, and I have asked for nothing;
I<br>
 have met none of my fellow-exiles; no one in Paris knows of
my<br>
 existence.</p>

<p>"I am dying in Christian beliefs. May God forgive the last of
the<br>
 Steinbocks!</p>

<p>"WENCESLAS."</p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
 Mademoiselle Fischer, deeply touched by the dying man's
honesty,<br>
 opened the drawer and found the five five-franc pieces to pay
his<br>
 rent.</p>

<p><br>
 "Poor young man!" cried she. "And with no one in the world to
care<br>
 about him!"</p>

<p>She went downstairs to fetch her work, and sat stitching in
the<br>
 garret, watching over the Livonian gentleman.</p>

<p>When he awoke his astonishment may be imagined on finding a
woman<br>
 sitting by his bed; it was like the prolongation of a dream. As
she<br>
 sat there, covering aiguillettes with gold thread, the old maid
had<br>
 resolved to take charge of the poor youth whom she admired as he
lay<br>
 sleeping.</p>

<p>As soon as the young Count was fully awake, Lisbeth talked to
give him<br>
 courage, and questioned him to find out how he might make a
living.<br>
 Wenceslas, after telling his story, added that he owed his
position to<br>
 his acknowledged talent for the fine arts. He had always had
a<br>
 preference for sculpture; the necessary time for study had,
however,<br>
 seemed to him too long for a man without money; and at this
moment he<br>
 was far too weak to do any hard manual labor or undertake an
important<br>
 work in sculpture. All this was Greek to Lisbeth Fischer. She
replied<br>
 to the unhappy man that Paris offered so many openings that any
man<br>
 with will and courage might find a living there. A man of spirit
need<br>
 never perish if he had a certain stock of endurance.</p>

<p>"I am but a poor girl myself, a peasant, and I have managed to
make<br>
 myself independent," said she in conclusion. "If you will work
in<br>
 earnest, I have saved a little money, and I will lend you, month
by<br>
 month, enough to live upon; but to live frugally, and not to
play<br>
 ducks and drakes with or squander in the streets. You can dine
in<br>
 Paris for twenty-five sous a day, and I will get you your
breakfast<br>
 with mine every day. I will furnish your rooms and pay for
such<br>
 teaching as you may think necessary. You shall give me
formal<br>
 acknowledgment for the money I may lay out for you, and when you
are<br>
 rich you shall repay me all. But if you do not work, I shall
not<br>
 regard myself as in any way pledged to you, and I shall leave
you to<br>
 your fate."</p>

<p>"Ah!" cried the poor fellow, still smarting from the
bitterness of his<br>
 first struggle with death, "exiles from every land may well
stretch<br>
 out their hands to France, as the souls in Purgatory do to
Paradise.<br>
 In what other country is such help to be found, and generous
hearts<br>
 even in such a garret as this? You will be everything to me,
my<br>
 beloved benefactress; I am your slave! Be my sweetheart," he
added,<br>
 with one of the caressing gestures familiar to the Poles, for
which<br>
 they are unjustly accused of servility.</p>

<p>"Oh, no; I am too jealous, I should make you unhappy; but I
will<br>
 gladly be a sort of comrade," replied Lisbeth.</p>

<p>"Ah, if only you knew how I longed for some fellow-creature,
even a<br>
 tyrant, who would have something to say to me when I was
struggling in<br>
 the vast solitude of Paris!" exclaimed Wenceslas. "I
regretted<br>
 Siberia, whither I should be sent by the Emperor if I went
home.--Be<br>
 my Providence!--I will work; I will be a better man than I am,
though<br>
 I am not such a bad fellow!"</p>

<p>"Will you do whatever I bid you?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Well, then, I will adopt you as my child," said she lightly.
"Here I<br>
 am with a son risen from the grave. Come! we will begin at once.
I<br>
 will go out and get what I want; you can dress, and come down
to<br>
 breakfast with me when I knock on the ceiling with the
broomstick."</p>

<p>That day, Mademoiselle Fischer made some inquiries, at the
houses to<br>
 which she carried her work home, as to the business of a
sculptor. By<br>
 dint of many questions she ended by hearing of the studio kept
by<br>
 Florent and Chanor, a house that made a special business of
casting<br>
 and finishing decorative bronzes and handsome silver plate.
Thither<br>
 she went with Steinbock, recommending him as an apprentice
in<br>
 sculpture, an idea that was regarded as too eccentric. Their
business<br>
 was to copy the works of the greatest artists, but they did not
teach<br>
 the craft. The old maid's persistent obstinacy so far succeeded
that<br>
 Steinbock was taken on to design ornament. He very soon learned
to<br>
 model ornament, and invented novelties; he had a gift for
it.</p>

<p>Five months after he was out of his apprenticeship as a
finisher, he<br>
 made acquaintance with Stidmann, the famous head of Florent's
studios.<br>
 Within twenty months Wenceslas was ahead of his master; but in
thirty<br>
 months the old maid's savings of sixteen years had melted
entirely.<br>
 Two thousand five hundred francs in gold!--a sum with which she
had<br>
 intended to purchase an annuity; and what was there to show for
it? A<br>
 Pole's receipt! And at this moment Lisbeth was working as hard
as in<br>
 her young days to supply the needs of her Livonian.</p>

<p>When she found herself the possessor of a piece of paper
instead of<br>
 her gold louis, she lost her head, and went to consult Monsieur
Rivet,<br>
 who for fifteen years had been his clever head-worker's friend
and<br>
 counselor. On hearing her story, Monsieur and Madame Rivet
scolded<br>
 Lisbeth, told her she was crazy, abused all refugees whose plots
for<br>
 reconstructing their nation compromised the prosperity of the
country<br>
 and the maintenance of peace; and they urged Lisbeth to find
what in<br>
 trade is called security.</p>

<p>"The only hold you have over this fellow is on his liberty,"
observed<br>
 Monsieur Rivet.</p>

<p>Monsieur Achille Rivet was assessor at the Tribunal of
Commerce.</p>

<p>"Imprisonment is no joke for a foreigner," said he. "A
Frenchman<br>
 remains five years in prison and comes out, free of his debts to
be<br>
 sure, for he is thenceforth bound only by his conscience, and
that<br>
 never troubles him; but a foreigner never comes out.--Give me
your<br>
 promissory note; my bookkeeper will take it up; he will get
it<br>
 protested; you will both be prosecuted and both be condemned
to<br>
 imprisonment in default of payment; then, when everything is in
due<br>
 form, you must sign a declaration. By doing this your interest
will be<br>
 accumulating, and you will have a pistol always primed to fire
at your<br>
 Pole!"</p>

<p>The old maid allowed these legal steps to be taken, telling
her<br>
 protege not to be uneasy, as the proceedings were merely to
afford a<br>
 guarantee to a money-lender who agreed to advance them certain
sums.<br>
 This subterfuge was due to the inventive genius of Monsieur
Rivet. The<br>
 guileless artist, blindly trusting to his benefactress, lighted
his<br>
 pipe with the stamped paper, for he smoked as all men do who
have<br>
 sorrows or energies that need soothing.</p>

<p>One fine day Monsieur Rivet showed Mademoiselle Fischer a
schedule,<br>
 and said to her:</p>

<p>"Here you have Wenceslas Steinbock bound hand and foot, and
so<br>
 effectually, that within twenty-four hours you can have him snug
in<br>
 Clichy for the rest of his days."</p>

<p>This worthy and honest judge at the Chamber of Commerce
experienced<br>
 that day the satisfaction that must come of having done a
malignant<br>
 good action. Beneficence has so many aspects in Paris that
this<br>
 contradictory expression really represents one of them. The
Livonian<br>
 being fairly entangled in the toils of commercial procedure, the
point<br>
 was to obtain payment; for the illustrious tradesman looked
on<br>
 Wenceslas as a swindler. Feeling, sincerity, poetry, were in his
eyes<br>
 mere folly in business matters.</p>

<p>So Rivet went off to see, in behalf of that poor Mademoiselle
Fischer,<br>
 who, as he said, had been "done" by the Pole, the rich
manufacturers<br>
 for whom Steinbock had worked. It happened that Stidmann--who,
with<br>
 the help of these distinguished masters of the goldsmiths' art,
was<br>
 raising French work to the perfection it has now reached,
allowing it<br>
 to hold its own against Florence and the Renaissance--Stidmann
was in<br>
 Chanor's private room when the army lace manufacturer called to
make<br>
 inquiries as to "One Steinbock, a Polish refugee."</p>

<p>"Whom do you call 'One Steinbock'? Do you mean a young
Livonian who<br>
 was a pupil of mine?" cried Stidmann ironically. "I may tell
you,<br>
 monsieur, that he is a very great artist. It is said of me that
I<br>
 believe myself to be the Devil. Well, that poor fellow does not
know<br>
 that he is capable of becoming a god."</p>

<p>"Indeed," said Rivet, well pleased. And then he added, "Though
you<br>
 take a rather cavalier tone with a man who has the honor to be
an<br>
 Assessor on the Tribunal of Commerce of the Department of the
Seine."</p>

<p>"Your pardon, Consul!" said Stidmann, with a military
salute.</p>

<p>"I am delighted," the Assessor went on, "to hear what you say.
The man<br>
 may make money then?"</p>

<p>"Certainly," said Chanor; "but he must work. He would have a
tidy sum<br>
 by now if he had stayed with us. What is to be done? Artists
have a<br>
 horror of not being free."</p>

<p>"They have a proper sense of their value and dignity,"
replied<br>
 Stidmann. "I do not blame Wenceslas for walking alone, trying to
make<br>
 a name, and to become a great man; he had a right to do so! But
he was<br>
 a great loss to me when he left."</p>

<p>"That, you see," exclaimed Rivet, "is what all young students
aim at<br>
 as soon as they are hatched out of the school-egg. Begin by
saving<br>
 money, I say, and seek glory afterwards."</p>

<p>"It spoils your touch to be picking up coin," said Stidmann.
"It is<br>
 Glory's business to bring us wealth."</p>

<p>"And, after all," said Chanor to Rivet, "you cannot tether
them."</p>

<p>"They would eat the halter," replied Stidmann.</p>

<p>"All these gentlemen have as much caprice as talent," said
Chanor,<br>
 looking at Stidmann. "They spend no end of money; they keep
their<br>
 girls, they throw coin out of window, and then they have no time
to<br>
 work. They neglect their orders; we have to employ workmen who
are<br>
 very inferior, but who grow rich; and then they complain of the
hard<br>
 times, while, if they were but steady, they might have piles of
gold."</p>

<p>"You old Lumignon," said Stidmann, "you remind me of the
publisher<br>
 before the Revolution who said--'If only I could keep
Montesquieu,<br>
 Voltaire, and Rousseau very poor in my backshed, and lock up
their<br>
 breeches in a cupboard, what a lot of nice little books they
would<br>
 write to make my fortune.'--If works of art could be hammered
out like<br>
 nails, workmen would make them.--Give me a thousand francs, and
don't<br>
 talk nonsense."</p>

<p>Worthy Monsieur Rivet went home, delighted for poor
Mademoiselle<br>
 Fischer, who dined with him every Monday, and whom he found
waiting<br>
 for him.</p>

<p>"If you can only make him work," said he, "you will have more
luck<br>
 than wisdom; you will be repaid, interest, capital, and costs.
This<br>
 Pole has talent, he can make a living; but lock up his trousers
and<br>
 his shoes, do not let him go to the <i>Chaumiere</i> or the
parish of<br>
 Notre-Dame de Lorette, keep him in leading-strings. If you do
not take<br>
 such precautions, your artist will take to loafing, and if you
only<br>
 knew what these artists mean by loafing! Shocking! Why, I have
just<br>
 heard that they will spend a thousand-franc note in a day!"</p>

<p>This episode had a fatal influence on the home-life of
Wenceslas and<br>
 Lisbeth. The benefactress flavored the exile's bread with the
wormwood<br>
 of reproof, now that she saw her money in danger, and often
believed<br>
 it to be lost. From a kind mother she became a stepmother; she
took<br>
 the poor boy to task, she nagged him, scolded him for working
too<br>
 slowly, and blamed him for having chosen so difficult a
profession.<br>
 She could not believe that those models in red wax--little
figures and<br>
 sketches for ornamental work--could be of any value. Before
long,<br>
 vexed with herself for her severity, she would try to efface the
tears<br>
 by her care and attention.</p>

<p>Then the poor young man, after groaning to think that he was
dependent<br>
 on this shrew and under the thumb of a peasant of the Vosges,
was<br>
 bewitched by her coaxing ways and by a maternal affection
that<br>
 attached itself solely to the physical and material side of
life. He<br>
 was like a woman who forgives a week of ill-usage for the sake
of a<br>
 kiss and a brief reconciliation.</p>

<p>Thus Mademoiselle Fischer obtained complete power over his
mind. The<br>
 love of dominion that lay as a germ in the old maid's heart
developed<br>
 rapidly. She could now satisfy her pride and her craving for
action;<br>
 had she not a creature belonging to her, to be schooled,
scolded,<br>
 flattered, and made happy, without any fear of a rival? Thus the
good<br>
 and bad sides of her nature alike found play. If she
sometimes<br>
 victimized the poor artist, she had, on the other hand,
delicate<br>
 impulses like the grace of wild flowers; it was a joy to her
to<br>
 provide for all his wants; she would have given her life for
him, and<br>
 Wenceslas knew it. Like every noble soul, the poor fellow forgot
the<br>
 bad points, the defects of the woman who had told him the story
of her<br>
 life as an excuse for her rough ways, and he remembered only
the<br>
 benefits she had done him.</p>

<p>One day, exasperated with Wenceslas for having gone out
walking<br>
 instead of sitting at work, she made a great scene.</p>

<p>"You belong to me," said she. "If you were an honest man, you
would<br>
 try to repay me the money you owe as soon as possible."</p>

<p>The gentleman, in whose veins the blood of the Steinbocks was
fired,<br>
 turned pale.</p>

<p>"Bless me," she went on, "we soon shall have nothing to live
on but<br>
 the thirty sous I earn--a poor work-woman!"</p>

<p>The two penniless creatures, worked up by their own war of
words, grew<br>
 vehement; and for the first time the unhappy artist reproached
his<br>
 benefactress for having rescued him from death only to make him
lead<br>
 the life of a galley slave, worse than the bottomless void,
where at<br>
 least, said he, he would have found rest. And he talked of
flight.</p>

<p>"Flight!" cried Lisbeth. "Ah, Monsieur Rivet was right."</p>

<p>And she clearly explained to the Pole that within twenty-four
hours he<br>
 might be clapped into prison for the rest of his days. It was
a<br>
 crushing blow. Steinbock sank into deep melancholy and total
silence.</p>

<p>In the course of the following night, Lisbeth hearing overhead
some<br>
 preparations for suicide, went up to her pensioner's room, and
gave<br>
 him the schedule and a formal release.</p>

<p>"Here, dear child, forgive me," she said with tears in her
eyes. "Be<br>
 happy; leave me! I am too cruel to you; only tell me that you
will<br>
 sometimes remember the poor girl who has enabled you to make a
living.<br>
 --What can I say? You are the cause of my ill-humor. I might
die;<br>
 where would you be without me? That is the reason of my
being<br>
 impatient to see you do some salable work. I do not want my
money back<br>
 for myself, I assure you! I am only frightened at your idleness,
which<br>
 you call meditation; at your ideas, which take up so many hours
when<br>
 you sit gazing at the sky; I want you to get into habits of
industry."</p>

<p>All this was said with an emphasis, a look, and tears that
moved the<br>
 high-minded artist; he clasped his benefactress to his heart
and<br>
 kissed her forehead.</p>

<p>"Keep these pieces," said he with a sort of cheerfulness. "Why
should<br>
 you send me to Clichy? Am I not a prisoner here out of
gratitude?"</p>

<p>This episode of their secret domestic life had occurred six
months<br>
 previously, and had led to Steinbock's producing three finished
works:<br>
 the seal in Hortense's possession, the group he had placed with
the<br>
 curiosity dealer, and a beautiful clock to which he was putting
the<br>
 last touches, screwing in the last rivets.</p>

<p>This clock represented the twelve Hours, charmingly
personified by<br>
 twelve female figures whirling round in so mad and swift a dance
that<br>
 three little Loves perched on a pile of fruit and flowers could
not<br>
 stop one of them; only the torn skirts of Midnight remained in
the<br>
 hand of the most daring cherub. The group stood on an
admirably<br>
 treated base, ornamented with grotesque beasts. The hours were
told by<br>
 a monstrous mouth that opened to yawn, and each Hour bore
some<br>
 ingeniously appropriate symbol characteristic of the various<br>
 occupations of the day.</p>

<p>It is now easy to understand the extraordinary attachment
of<br>
 Mademoiselle Fischer for her Livonian; she wanted him to be
happy, and<br>
 she saw him pining, fading away in his attic. The causes of
this<br>
 wretched state of affairs may be easily imagined. The peasant
woman<br>
 watched this son of the North with the affection of a mother,
with the<br>
 jealousy of a wife, and the spirit of a dragon; hence she
managed to<br>
 put every kind of folly or dissipation out of his power by
leaving him<br>
 destitute of money. She longed to keep her victim and companion
for<br>
 herself alone, well conducted perforce, and she had no
conception of<br>
 the cruelty of this senseless wish, since she, for her own part,
was<br>
 accustomed to every privation. She loved Steinbock well enough
not to<br>
 marry him, and too much to give him up to any other woman; she
could<br>
 not resign herself to be no more than a mother to him, though
she saw<br>
 that she was mad to think of playing the other part.</p>

<p>These contradictions, this ferocious jealousy, and the joy of
having a<br>
 man to herself, all agitated her old maid's heart beyond
measure.<br>
 Really in love as she had been for four years, she cherished
the<br>
 foolish hope of prolonging this impossible and aimless way of
life in<br>
 which her persistence would only be the ruin of the man she
thought of<br>
 as her child. This contest between her instincts and her reason
made<br>
 her unjust and tyrannical. She wreaked on the young man her
vengeance<br>
 for her own lot in being neither young, rich, nor handsome;
then,<br>
 after each fit of rage, recognizing herself wrong, she stooped
to<br>
 unlimited humility, infinite tenderness. She never could
sacrifice to<br>
 her idol till she had asserted her power by blows of the axe. In
fact,<br>
 it was the converse of Shakespeare's <i>Tempest</i>--Caliban
ruling Ariel<br>
 and Prospero.</p>

<p>As to the poor youth himself, high-minded, meditative, and
inclined to<br>
 be lazy, the desert that his protectress made in his soul might
be<br>
 seen in his eyes, as in those of a caged lion. The penal
servitude<br>
 forced on him by Lisbeth did not fulfil the cravings of his
heart. His<br>
 weariness became a physical malady, and he was dying without
daring to<br>
 ask, or knowing where to procure, the price of some little
necessary<br>
 dissipation. On some days of special energy, when a feeling of
utter<br>
 ill-luck added to his exasperation, he would look at Lisbeth as
a<br>
 thirsty traveler on a sandy shore must look at the bitter
sea-water.</p>

<p>These harsh fruits of indigence, and this isolation in the
midst of<br>
 Paris, Lisbeth relished with delight. And besides, she foresaw
that<br>
 the first passion would rob her of her slave. Sometimes she
even<br>
 blamed herself because her own tyranny and reproaches had
compelled<br>
 the poetic youth to become so great an artist of delicate work,
and<br>
 she had thus given him the means of casting her off.</p>

<p>On the day after, these three lives, so differently but so
utterly<br>
 wretched--that of a mother in despair, that of the Marneffe
household,<br>
 and that of the unhappy exile--were all to be influenced by
Hortense's<br>
 guileless passion, and by the strange outcome of the Baron's
luckless<br>
 passion for Josepha.</p>

<p>Just as Hulot was going into the opera-house, he was stopped
by the<br>
 darkened appearance of the building and of the Rue le Peletier,
where<br>
 there were no gendarmes, no lights, no theatre-servants, no
barrier to<br>
 regulate the crowd. He looked up at the announcement-board, and
beheld<br>
 a strip of white paper, on which was printed the solemn
notice:</p>

<p>"CLOSED ON ACCOUNT OF ILLNESS."</p>

<p>He rushed off to Josepha's lodgings in the Rue Chauchat; for,
like all<br>
 the singers, she lived close at hand.</p>

<p>"Whom do you want, sir?" asked the porter, to the Baron's
great<br>
 astonishment.</p>

<p>"Have you forgotten me?" said Hulot, much puzzled.</p>

<p>"On the contrary, sir, it is because I have the honor to
remember you<br>
 that I ask you, Where are you going?"</p>

<p>A mortal chill fell upon the Baron.</p>

<p>"What has happened?" he asked.</p>

<p><br>
 "If you go up to Mademoiselle Mirah's rooms, Monsieur le Baron,
you<br>
 will find Mademoiselle Heloise Brisetout there--and Monsieur
Bixiou,<br>
 Monsieur Leon de Lora, Monsieur Lousteau, Monsieur de
Vernisset,<br>
 Monsieur Stidmann; and ladies smelling of patchouli--holding
a<br>
 housewarming."</p>

<p>"Then, where--where is----?"</p>

<p>"Mademoiselle Mirah?--I don't know that I ought to tell
you."</p>

<p>The Baron slipped two five-franc pieces into the porter's
hand.</p>

<p>"Well, she is now in the Rue de la Ville l'Eveque, in a fine
house,<br>
 given to her, they say, by the Duc d'Herouville," replied the
man in a<br>
 whisper.</p>

<p>Having ascertained the number of the house, Monsieur Hulot
called a<br>
 <i>milord</i> and drove to one of those pretty modern houses
with double<br>
 doors, where everything, from the gaslight at the entrance,
proclaims<br>
 luxury.</p>

<p>The Baron, in his blue cloth coat, white neckcloth, nankeen
trousers,<br>
 patent leather boots, and stiffly starched shirt-frill, was
supposed<br>
 to be a guest, though a late arrival, by the janitor of this new
Eden.<br>
 His alacrity of manner and quick step justified this
opinion.</p>

<p>The porter rang a bell, and a footman appeared in the hall.
This man,<br>
 as new as the house, admitted the visitor, who said to him in
an<br>
 imperious tone, and with a lordly gesture:</p>

<p>"Take in this card to Mademoiselle Josepha."</p>

<p>The victim mechanically looked round the room in which he
found<br>
 himself--an anteroom full of choice flowers and of furniture
that must<br>
 have cost twenty thousand francs. The servant, on his return,
begged<br>
 monsieur to wait in the drawing-room till the company came to
their<br>
 coffee.</p>

<p>Though the Baron had been familiar with Imperial luxury, which
was<br>
 undoubtedly prodigious, while its productions, though not
durable in<br>
 kind, had nevertheless cost enormous sums, he stood dazzled,<br>
 dumfounded, in this drawing-room with three windows looking out
on a<br>
 garden like fairyland, one of those gardens that are created in
a<br>
 month with a made soil and transplanted shrubs, while the grass
seems<br>
 as if it must be made to grow by some chemical process. He
admired not<br>
 only the decoration, the gilding, the carving, in the most
expensive<br>
 Pompadour style, as it is called, and the magnificent brocades,
all of<br>
 which any enriched tradesman could have procured for money; but
he<br>
 also noted such treasures as only princes can select and find,
can pay<br>
 for and give away; two pictures by Greuze, two by Watteau, two
heads<br>
 by Vandyck, two landscapes by Ruysdael, and two by le Guaspre,
a<br>
 Rembrandt, a Holbein, a Murillo, and a Titian, two paintings,
by<br>
 Teniers, and a pair by Metzu, a Van Huysum, and an Abraham
Mignon--in<br>
 short, two hundred thousand francs' worth of pictures superbly
framed.<br>
 The gilding was worth almost as much as the paintings.</p>

<p>"Ah, ha! Now you understand, my good man?" said Josepha.</p>

<p>She had stolen in on tiptoe through a noiseless door, over
Persian<br>
 carpets, and came upon her adorer, standing lost in
amazement--in the<br>
 stupid amazement when a man's ears tingle so loudly that he
hears<br>
 nothing but that fatal knell.</p>

<p>The words "my good man," spoken to an official of such
high<br>
 importance, so perfectly exemplified the audacity with which
these<br>
 creatures pour contempt on the loftiest, that the Baron was
nailed to<br>
 the spot. Josepha, in white and yellow, was so beautifully
dressed for<br>
 the banquet, that amid all this lavish magnificence she still
shone<br>
 like a rare jewel.</p>

<p>"Isn't this really fine?" said she. "The Duke has spent all
the money<br>
 on it that he got out of floating a company, of which the shares
all<br>
 sold at a premium. He is no fool, is my little Duke. There is
nothing<br>
 like a man who has been a grandee in his time for turning coals
into<br>
 gold. Just before dinner the notary brought me the title-deeds
to sign<br>
 and the bills receipted!--They are all a first-class set in
there--<br>
 d'Esgrignon, Rastignac, Maxime, Lenoncourt, Verneuil,
Laginski,<br>
 Rochefide, la Palferine, and from among the bankers Nucingen and
du<br>
 Tillet, with Antonia, Malaga, Carabine, and la Schontz; and they
all<br>
 feel for you deeply.--Yes, old boy, and they hope you will join
them,<br>
 but on condition that you forthwith drink up to two bottles full
of<br>
 Hungarian wine, Champagne, or Cape, just to bring you up to
their<br>
 mark.--My dear fellow, we are all so much <i>on</i> here, that
it was<br>
 necessary to close the Opera. The manager is as drunk as a
cornet-a-<br>
 piston; he is hiccuping already."</p>

<p>"Oh, Josepha!----" cried the Baron.</p>

<p>"Now, can anything be more absurd than explanations?" she
broke in<br>
 with a smile. "Look here; can you stand six hundred thousand
francs<br>
 which this house and furniture cost? Can you give me a bond to
the<br>
 tune of thirty thousand francs a year, which is what the Duke
has just<br>
 given me in a packet of common sugared almonds from the
grocer's?--a<br>
 pretty notion that----"</p>

<p>"What an atrocity!" cried Hulot, who in his fury would have
given his<br>
 wife's diamonds to stand in the Duc d'Herouville's shoes for
twenty-<br>
 four hours.</p>

<p>"Atrocity is my trade," said she. "So that is how you take it?
Well,<br>
 why don't you float a company? Goodness me! my poor dyed Tom,
you<br>
 ought to be grateful to me; I have thrown you over just when you
would<br>
 have spent on me your widow's fortune, your daughter's
portion.--What,<br>
 tears! The Empire is a thing of the past--I hail the coming
Empire!"</p>

<p>She struck a tragic attitude, and exclaimed:</p>

<p>"They call you Hulot! Nay, I know you not--"</p>

<p>And she went into the other room.</p>

<p>Through the door, left ajar, there came, like a
lightning-flash, a<br>
 streak of light with an accompaniment of the crescendo of the
orgy and<br>
 the fragrance of a banquet of the choicest description.</p>

<p>The singer peeped through the partly open door, and seeing
Hulot<br>
 transfixed as if he had been a bronze image, she came one step
forward<br>
 into the room.</p>

<p>"Monsieur," said she, "I have handed over the rubbish in the
Rue<br>
 Chauchat to Bixiou's little Heloise Brisetout. If you wish to
claim<br>
 your cotton nightcap, your bootjack, your belt, and your wax
dye, I<br>
 have stipulated for their return."</p>

<p>This insolent banter made the Baron leave the room as
precipitately as<br>
 Lot departed from Gomorrah, but he did not look back like Mrs.
Lot.</p>

<p>Hulot went home, striding along in a fury, and talking to
himself; he<br>
 found his family still playing the game of whist at two sous a
point,<br>
 at which he left them. On seeing her husband return, poor
Adeline<br>
 imagined something dreadful, some dishonor; she gave her cards
to<br>
 Hortense, and led Hector away into the very room where, only
five<br>
 hours since, Crevel had foretold her the utmost disgrace of
poverty.</p>

<p>"What is the matter?" she said, terrified.</p>

<p>"Oh, forgive me--but let me tell you all these horrors." And
for ten<br>
 minutes he poured out his wrath.</p>

<p>"But, my dear," said the unhappy woman, with heroic courage,
"these<br>
 creatures do not know what love means--such pure and devoted
love as<br>
 you deserve. How could you, so clear-sighted as you are, dream
of<br>
 competing with millions?"</p>

<p>"Dearest Adeline!" cried the Baron, clasping her to his
heart.</p>

<p>The Baroness' words had shed balm on the bleeding wounds to
his<br>
 vanity.</p>

<p>"To be sure, take away the Duc d'Herouville's fortune, and she
could<br>
 not hesitate between us!" said the Baron.</p>

<p>"My dear," said Adeline with a final effort, "if you
positively must<br>
 have mistresses, why do you not seek them, like Crevel, among
women<br>
 who are less extravagant, and of a class that can for a time
be<br>
 content with little? We should all gain by that
arrangement.--I<br>
 understand your need--but I do not understand that
vanity----"</p>

<p>"Oh, what a kind and perfect wife you are!" cried he. "I am an
old<br>
 lunatic, I do not deserve to have such a wife!"</p>

<p>"I am simply the Josephine of my Napoleon," she replied, with
a touch<br>
 of melancholy.</p>

<p>"Josephine was not to compare with you!" said he. "Come; I
will play a<br>
 game of whist with my brother and the children. I must try my
hand at<br>
 the business of a family man; I must get Hortense a husband, and
bury<br>
 the libertine."</p>

<p>His frankness so greatly touched poor Adeline, that she
said:</p>

<p>"The creature has no taste to prefer any man in the world to
my<br>
 Hector. Oh, I would not give you up for all the gold on earth.
How can<br>
 any woman throw you over who is so happy as to be loved by
you?"</p>

<p>The look with which the Baron rewarded his wife's fanaticism
confirmed<br>
 her in her opinion that gentleness and docility were a
woman's<br>
 strongest weapons.</p>

<p>But in this she was mistaken. The noblest sentiments, carried
to an<br>
 excess, can produce mischief as great as do the worst vices.
Bonaparte<br>
 was made Emperor for having fired on the people, at a stone's
throw<br>
 from the spot where Louis XVI. lost his throne and his head
because he<br>
 would not allow a certain Monsieur Sauce to be hurt.</p>

<p>On the following morning, Hortense, who had slept with the
seal under<br>
 her pillow, so as to have it close to her all night, dressed
very<br>
 early, and sent to beg her father to join her in the garden as
soon as<br>
 he should be down.</p>

<p>By about half-past nine, the father, acceding to his
daughter's<br>
 petition, gave her his arm for a walk, and they went along the
quays<br>
 by the Pont Royal to the Place du Carrousel.</p>

<p>"Let us look into the shop windows, papa," said Hortense, as
they went<br>
 through the little gate to cross the wide square.</p>

<p>"What--here?" said her father, laughing at her.</p>

<p>"We are supposed to have come to see the pictures, and over
there"--<br>
 and she pointed to the stalls in front of the houses at a right
angle<br>
 to the Rue du Doyenne--"look! there are dealers in curiosities
and<br>
 pictures----"</p>

<p>"Your cousin lives there."</p>

<p>"I know it, but she must not see us."</p>

<p>"And what do you want to do?" said the Baron, who, finding
himself<br>
 within thirty yards of Madame Marneffe's windows, suddenly
remembered<br>
 her.</p>

<p>Hortense had dragged her father in front of one of the shops
forming<br>
 the angle of a block of houses built along the front of the
Old<br>
 Louvre, and facing the Hotel de Nantes. She went into this shop;
her<br>
 father stood outside, absorbed in gazing at the windows of the
pretty<br>
 little lady, who, the evening before, had left her image stamped
on<br>
 the old beau's heart, as if to alleviate the wound he was so
soon to<br>
 receive; and he could not help putting his wife's sage advice
into<br>
 practice.</p>

<p>"I will fall back on a simple little citizen's wife," said he
to<br>
 himself, recalling Madame Marneffe's adorable graces. "Such a
woman as<br>
 that will soon make me forget that grasping Josepha."</p>

<p>Now, this was what was happening at the same moment outside
and inside<br>
 the curiosity shop.</p>

<p>As he fixed his eyes on the windows of his new <i>belle</i>,
the Baron saw<br>
 the husband, who, while brushing his coat with his own hands,
was<br>
 apparently on the lookout, expecting to see some one on the
square.<br>
 Fearing lest he should be seen, and subsequently recognized,
the<br>
 amorous Baron turned his back on the Rue du Doyenne, or rather
stood<br>
 at three-quarters' face, as it were, so as to be able to glance
round<br>
 from time to time. This manoeuvre brought him face to face with
Madame<br>
 Marneffe, who, coming up from the quay, was doubling the
promontory of<br>
 houses to go home.</p>

<p>Valerie was evidently startled as she met the Baron's
astonished eye,<br>
 and she responded with a prudish dropping of her eyelids.</p>

<p>"A pretty woman," exclaimed he, "for whom a man would do many
foolish<br>
 things."</p>

<p>"Indeed, monsieur?" said she, turning suddenly, like a woman
who has<br>
 just come to some vehement decision, "you are Monsieur le Baron
Hulot,<br>
 I believe?"</p>

<p>The Baron, more and more bewildered, bowed assent.</p>

<p>"Then, as chance has twice made our eyes meet, and I am so
fortunate<br>
 as to have interested or puzzled you, I may tell you that,
instead of<br>
 doing anything foolish, you ought to do justice.--My husband's
fate<br>
 rests with you."</p>

<p>"And how may that be?" asked the gallant Baron.</p>

<p>"He is employed in your department in the War Office, under
Monsieur<br>
 Lebrun, in Monsieur Coquet's room," said she with a smile.</p>

<p>"I am quite disposed, Madame--Madame----?"</p>

<p>"Madame Marneffe."</p>

<p>"Dear little Madame Marneffe, to do injustice for your
sake.--I have a<br>
 cousin living in your house; I will go to see her one day
soon--as<br>
 soon as possible; bring your petition to me in her rooms."</p>

<p>"Pardon my boldness, Monsieur le Baron; you must understand
that if I<br>
 dare to address you thus, it is because I have no friend to
protect<br>
 me----"</p>

<p>"Ah, ha!"</p>

<p>"Monsieur, you misunderstand me," said she, lowering her
eyelids.</p>

<p>Hulot felt as if the sun had disappeared.</p>

<p>"I am at my wits' end, but I am an honest woman!" she went on.
"About<br>
 six months ago my only protector died, Marshal Montcornet--"</p>

<p>"Ah! You are his daughter?"</p>

<p>"Yes, monsieur; but he never acknowledged me."</p>

<p>"That was that he might leave you part of his fortune."</p>

<p>"He left me nothing; he made no will."</p>

<p>"Indeed! Poor little woman! The Marshal died suddenly of
apoplexy.<br>
 But, come, madame, hope for the best. The State must do
something for<br>
 the daughter of one of the Chevalier Bayards of the Empire."</p>

<p>Madame Marneffe bowed gracefully and went off, as proud of her
success<br>
 as the Baron was of his.</p>

<p>"Where the devil has she been so early?" thought he watching
the flow<br>
 of her skirts, to which she contrived to impart a somewhat
exaggerated<br>
 grace. "She looks too tired to have just come from a bath, and
her<br>
 husband is waiting for her. It is strange, and puzzles me
altogether."</p>

<p>Madame Marneffe having vanished within, the Baron wondered
what his<br>
 daughter was doing in the shop. As he went in, still staring at
Madame<br>
 Marneffe's windows, he ran against a young man with a pale brow
and<br>
 sparkling gray eyes, wearing a summer coat of black merino,
coarse<br>
 drill trousers, and tan shoes, with gaiters, rushing away
headlong; he<br>
 saw him run to the house in the Rue du Doyenne, into which he
went.</p>

<p>Hortense, on going into the shop, had at once recognized the
famous<br>
 group, conspicuously placed on a table in the middle and in
front of<br>
 the door. Even without the circumstances to which she owed
her<br>
 knowledge of this masterpiece, it would probably have struck her
by<br>
 the peculiar power which we must call the <i>brio</i>--the
<i>go</i>--of great<br>
 works; and the girl herself might in Italy have been taken as a
model<br>
 for the personification of <i>Brio</i>.</p>

<p><br>
 Not every work by a man of genius has in the same degree
that<br>
 brilliancy, that glory which is at once patent even to the
most<br>
 ignoble beholder. Thus, certain pictures by Raphael, such as
the<br>
 famous <i>Transfiguration</i>, the <i>Madonna di Foligno</i>,
and the frescoes<br>
 of the <i>Stanze</i> in the Vatican, do not at first captivate
our<br>
 admiration, as do the <i>Violin-player</i> in the Sciarra
Palace, the<br>
 portraits of the Doria family, and the <i>Vision of Ezekiel</i>
in the<br>
 Pitti Gallery, the <i>Christ bearing His Cross</i> in the
Borghese<br>
 collection, and the <i>Marriage of the Virgin</i> in the Brera
at Milan.<br>
 The <i>Saint John the Baptist</i> of the Tribuna, and <i>Saint
Luke painting</i><br>
 <i>the Virgin's portrait</i> in the Accademia at Rome, have not
the charm of<br>
 the <i>Portrait of Leo X.</i>, and of the <i>Virgin</i> at
Dresden.</p>

<p>And yet they are all of equal merit. Nay, more. The
<i>Stanze</i>, the<br>
 <i>Transfiguration</i>, the panels, and the three easel pictures
in the<br>
 Vatican are in the highest degree perfect and sublime. But they
demand<br>
 a stress of attention, even from the most accomplished beholder,
and<br>
 serious study, to be fully understood; while the
<i>Violin-player</i>, the<br>
 <i>Marriage of the Virgin</i>, and the <i>Vision of Ezekiel</i>
go straight to<br>
 the heart through the portal of sight, and make their home
there. It<br>
 is a pleasure to receive them thus without an effort; if it is
not the<br>
 highest phase of art, it is the happiest. This fact proves that,
in<br>
 the begetting of works of art, there is as much chance in
the<br>
 character of the offspring as there is in a family of children;
that<br>
 some will be happily graced, born beautiful, and costing their
mothers<br>
 little suffering, creatures on whom everything smiles, and with
whom<br>
 everything succeeds; in short, genius, like love, has its
fairer<br>
 blossoms.</p>

<p>This <i>brio</i>, an Italian word which the French have begun
to use, is<br>
 characteristic of youthful work. It is the fruit of an impetus
and<br>
 fire of early talent--an impetus which is met with again later
in some<br>
 happy hours; but this particular <i>brio</i> no longer comes
from the<br>
 artist's heart; instead of his flinging it into his work as a
volcano<br>
 flings up its fires, it comes to him from outside, inspired
by<br>
 circumstances, by love, or rivalry, often by hatred, and more
often<br>
 still by the imperious need of glory to be lived up to.</p>

<p>This group by Wenceslas was to his later works what the
<i>Marriage of</i><br>
 <i>the Virgin</i> is to the great mass of Raphael's, the first
step of a<br>
 gifted artist taken with the inimitable grace, the eagerness,
and<br>
 delightful overflowingness of a child, whose strength is
concealed<br>
 under the pink-and-white flesh full of dimples which seem to
echo to a<br>
 mother's laughter. Prince Eugene is said to have paid four
hundred<br>
 thousand francs for this picture, which would be worth a million
to<br>
 any nation that owned no picture by Raphael, but no one would
give<br>
 that sum for the finest of the frescoes, though their value is
far<br>
 greater as works of art.</p>

<p>Hortense restrained her admiration, for she reflected on the
amount of<br>
 her girlish savings; she assumed an air of indifference, and
said to<br>
 the dealer:</p>

<p>"What is the price of that?"</p>

<p>"Fifteen hundred francs," replied the man, sending a glance
of<br>
 intelligence to a young man seated on a stool in the corner.</p>

<p>The young man himself gazed in a stupefaction at Monsieur
Hulot's<br>
 living masterpiece. Hortense, forewarned, at once identified him
as<br>
 the artist, from the color that flushed a face pale with
endurance;<br>
 she saw the spark lighted up in his gray eyes by her question;
she<br>
 looked on the thin, drawn features, like those of a monk
consumed by<br>
 asceticism; she loved the red, well-formed mouth, the delicate
chin,<br>
 and the Pole's silky chestnut hair.</p>

<p>"If it were twelve hundred," said she, "I would beg you to
send it to<br>
 me."</p>

<p>"It is antique, mademoiselle," the dealer remarked, thinking,
like all<br>
 his fraternity, that, having uttered this <i>ne plus ultra</i>
of bric-a-<br>
 brac, there was no more to be said.</p>

<p>"Excuse me, monsieur," she replied very quietly, "it was made
this<br>
 year; I came expressly to beg you, if my price is accepted, to
send<br>
 the artist to see us, as it might be possible to procure him
some<br>
 important commissions."</p>

<p>"And if he is to have the twelve hundred francs, what am I
to<br>
 get? I am the dealer," said the man, with candid good-humor.</p>

<p>"To be sure!" replied the girl, with a slight curl of
disdain.</p>

<p>"Oh! mademoiselle, take it; I will make terms with the
dealer,"<br>
 cried the Livonian, beside himself.</p>

<p>Fascinated by Hortense's wonderful beauty and the love of art
she<br>
 displayed, he added:</p>

<p>"I am the sculptor of the group, and for ten days I have come
here<br>
 three times a day to see if anybody would recognize its merit
and<br>
 bargain for it. You are my first admirer--take it!"</p>

<p>"Come, then, monsieur, with the dealer, an hour hence.--Here
is my<br>
 father's card," replied Hortense.</p>

<p>Then, seeing the shopkeeper go into a back room to wrap the
group in a<br>
 piece of linen rag, she added in a low voice, to the great<br>
 astonishment of the artist, who thought he must be dreaming:</p>

<p>"For the benefit of your future prospects, Monsieur Wenceslas,
do not<br>
 mention the name of the purchaser to Mademoiselle Fischer, for
she is<br>
 our cousin."</p>

<p>The word cousin dazzled the artist's mind; he had a glimpse
of<br>
 Paradise whence this daughter of Eve had come to him. He had
dreamed<br>
 of the beautiful girl of whom Lisbeth had told him, as Hortense
had<br>
 dreamed of her cousin's lover; and, as she had entered the
shop--</p>

<p>"Ah!" thought he, "if she could but be like this!"</p>

<p>The look that passed between the lovers may be imagined; it
was a<br>
 flame, for virtuous lovers have no hypocrisies.</p>

<p>"Well, what the deuce are you doing here?" her father asked
her.</p>

<p>"I have been spending twelve hundred francs that I had saved.
Come."<br>
 And she took her father's arm.</p>

<p>"Twelve hundred francs?" he repeated.</p>

<p>"To be exact, thirteen hundred; you will lend me the odd
hundred?"</p>

<p>"And on what, in such a place, could you spend so much?"</p>

<p>"Ah! that is the question!" replied the happy girl. "If I have
got a<br>
 husband, he is not dear at the money."</p>

<p>"A husband! In that shop, my child?"</p>

<p>"Listen, dear little father; would you forbid my marrying a
great<br>
 artist?"</p>

<p>"No, my dear. A great artist in these days is a prince without
a title<br>
 --he has glory and fortune, the two chief social
advantages--next to<br>
 virtue," he added, in a smug tone.</p>

<p>"Oh, of course!" said Hortense. "And what do you think of
sculpture?"</p>

<p>"It is very poor business," replied Hulot, shaking his head.
"It needs<br>
 high patronage as well as great talent, for Government is the
only<br>
 purchaser. It is an art with no demand nowadays, where there are
no<br>
 princely houses, no great fortunes, no entailed mansions, no<br>
 hereditary estates. Only small pictures and small figures can
find a<br>
 place; the arts are endangered by this need of small
things."</p>

<p>"But if a great artist could find a demand?" said
Hortense.</p>

<p>"That indeed would solve the problem."</p>

<p>"Or had some one to back him?"</p>

<p>"That would be even better."</p>

<p>"If he were of noble birth?"</p>

<p>"Pooh!"</p>

<p>"A Count."</p>

<p>"And a sculptor?"</p>

<p>"He has no money."</p>

<p>"And so he counts on that of Mademoiselle Hortense Hulot?"
said the<br>
 Baron ironically, with an inquisitorial look into his daughter's
eyes.</p>

<p>"This great artist, a Count and a sculptor, has just seen
your<br>
 daughter for the first time in his life, and for the space of
five<br>
 minutes, Monsieur le Baron," Hortense calmly replied.
"Yesterday, you<br>
 must know, dear little father, while you were at the Chamber,
mamma<br>
 had a fainting fit. This, which she ascribed to a nervous
attack, was<br>
 the result of some worry that had to do with the failure of
my<br>
 marriage, for she told me that to get rid of me---"</p>

<p>"She is too fond of you to have used an expression----"</p>

<p>"So unparliamentary!" Hortense put in with a laugh. "No, she
did not<br>
 use those words; but I know that a girl old enough to marry and
who<br>
 does not find a husband is a heavy cross for respectable parents
to<br>
 bear.--Well, she thinks that if a man of energy and talent could
be<br>
 found, who would be satisfied with thirty thousand francs for
my<br>
 marriage portion, we might all be happy. In fact, she thought
it<br>
 advisable to prepare me for the modesty of my future lot, and
to<br>
 hinder me from indulging in too fervid dreams.--Which evidently
meant<br>
 an end to the intended marriage, and no settlements for me!"</p>

<p><br>
 "Your mother is a very good woman, noble, admirable!" replied
the<br>
 father, deeply humiliated, though not sorry to hear this
confession.</p>

<p>"She told me yesterday that she had your permission to sell
her<br>
 diamonds so as to give me something to marry on; but I should
like her<br>
 to keep her jewels, and to find a husband myself. I think I have
found<br>
 the man, the possible husband, answering to mamma's
prospectus----"</p>

<p>"There?--in the Place du Carrousel?--and in one morning?"</p>

<p>"Oh, papa, the mischief lies deeper!" said she archly.</p>

<p>"Well, come, my child, tell the whole story to your good old
father,"<br>
 said he persuasively, and concealing his uneasiness.</p>

<p>Under promise of absolute secrecy, Hortense repeated the
upshot of her<br>
 various conversations with her Cousin Betty. Then, when they got
home,<br>
 she showed the much-talked-of-seal to her father in evidence of
the<br>
 sagacity of her views. The father, in the depth of his heart,
wondered<br>
 at the skill and acumen of girls who act on instinct, discerning
the<br>
 simplicity of the scheme which her idealized love had suggested
in the<br>
 course of a single night to his guileless daughter.</p>

<p>"You will see the masterpiece I have just bought; it is to be
brought<br>
 home, and that dear Wenceslas is to come with the dealer.--The
man who<br>
 made that group ought to make a fortune; only use your influence
to<br>
 get him an order for a statue, and rooms at the
Institut----"</p>

<p>"How you run on!" cried her father. "Why, if you had your own
way, you<br>
 would be man and wife within the legal period--in eleven
days----"</p>

<p>"Must we wait so long?" said she, laughing. "But I fell in
love with<br>
 him in five minutes, as you fell in love with mamma at first
sight.<br>
 And he loves me as if we had known each other for two years.
Yes," she<br>
 said in reply to her father's look, "I read ten volumes of love
in his<br>
 eyes. And will not you and mamma accept him as my husband when
you see<br>
 that he is a man of genius? Sculpture is the greatest of the
Arts,"<br>
 she cried, clapping her hands and jumping. "I will tell you<br>
 everything----"</p>

<p>"What, is there more to come?" asked her father, smiling.</p>

<p>The child's complete and effervescent innocence had restored
her<br>
 father's peace of mind.</p>

<p>"A confession of the first importance," said she. "I loved him
without<br>
 knowing him; and, for the last hour, since seeing him, I am
crazy<br>
 about him."</p>

<p>"A little too crazy!" said the Baron, who was enjoying the
sight of<br>
 this guileless passion.</p>

<p>"Do not punish me for confiding in you," replied she. "It is
so<br>
 delightful to say to my father's heart, 'I love him! I am so
happy in<br>
 loving him!'--You will see my Wenceslas! His brow is so sad. The
sun<br>
 of genius shines in his gray eyes--and what an air he has! What
do you<br>
 think of Livonia? Is it a fine country?--The idea of Cousin
Betty's<br>
 marrying that young fellow! She might be his mother. It would
be<br>
 murder! I am quite jealous of all she has ever done for him. But
I<br>
 don't think my marriage will please her."</p>

<p>"See, my darling, we must hide nothing from your mother."</p>

<p>"I should have to show her the seal, and I promised not to
betray<br>
 Cousin Lisbeth, who is afraid, she says, of mamma's laughing at
her,"<br>
 said Hortense.</p>

<p>"You have scruples about the seal, and none about robbing your
cousin<br>
 of her lover."</p>

<p>"I promised about the seal--I made no promise about the
sculptor."</p>

<p>This adventure, patriarchal in its simplicity, came admirably
<i>a</i><br>
 <i>propos</i> to the unconfessed poverty of the family; the
Baron, while<br>
 praising his daughter for her candor, explained to her that she
must<br>
 now leave matters to the discretion of her parents.</p>

<p>"You understand, my child, that it is not your part to
ascertain<br>
 whether your cousin's lover is a Count, if he has all his
papers<br>
 properly certified, and if his conduct is a guarantee for
his<br>
 respectability.--As for your cousin, she refused five offers
when she<br>
 was twenty years younger; that will prove no obstacle, I
undertake to<br>
 say."</p>

<p>"Listen to me, papa; if you really wish to see me married,
never say a<br>
 word to Lisbeth about it till just before the contract is
signed. I<br>
 have been catechizing her about this business for the last six
months!<br>
 Well, there is something about her quite inexplicable----"</p>

<p>"What?" said her father, puzzled.</p>

<p>"Well, she looks evil when I say too much, even in joke, about
her<br>
 lover. Make inquiries, but leave me to row my own boat. My
confidence<br>
 ought to reassure you."</p>

<p>"The Lord said, 'Suffer little children to come unto Me.' You
are one<br>
 of those who have come back again," replied the Baron with a
touch of<br>
 irony.</p>

<p>After breakfast the dealer was announced, and the artist with
his<br>
 group. The sudden flush that reddened her daughter's face at
once made<br>
 the Baroness suspicious and then watchful, and the girl's
confusion<br>
 and the light in her eyes soon betrayed the mystery so badly
guarded<br>
 in her simple heart.</p>

<p>Count Steinbock, dressed in black, struck the Baron as a
very<br>
 gentlemanly young man.</p>

<p>"Would you undertake a bronze statue?" he asked, as he held up
the<br>
 group.</p>

<p>After admiring it on trust, he passed it on to his wife, who
knew<br>
 nothing about sculpture.</p>

<p>"It is beautiful, isn't it, mamma?" said Hortense in her
mother' ear.</p>

<p>"A statue! Monsieur, it is less difficult to execute a statue
than to<br>
 make a clock like this, which my friend here has been kind
enough to<br>
 bring," said the artist in reply.</p>

<p>The dealer was placing on the dining-room sideboard the wax
model of<br>
 the twelve Hours that the Loves were trying to delay.</p>

<p>"Leave the clock with me," said the Baron, astounded at the
beauty of<br>
 the sketch. "I should like to show it to the Ministers of the
Interior<br>
 and of Commerce."</p>

<p>"Who is the young man in whom you take so much interest?" the
Baroness<br>
 asked her daughter.</p>

<p>"An artist who could afford to execute this model could get a
hundred<br>
 thousand francs for it," said the curiosity-dealer, putting on
a<br>
 knowing and mysterious look as he saw that the artist and the
girl<br>
 were interchanging glances. "He would only need to sell twenty
copies<br>
 at eight thousand francs each--for the materials would cost
about a<br>
 thousand crowns for each example. But if each copy were numbered
and<br>
 the mould destroyed, it would certainly be possible to meet
with<br>
 twenty amateurs only too glad to possess a replica of such a
work."</p>

<p>"A hundred thousand francs!" cried Steinbock, looking from the
dealer<br>
 to Hortense, the Baron, and the Baroness.</p>

<p>"Yes, a hundred thousand francs," repeated the dealer. "If I
were rich<br>
 enough, I would buy it of you myself for twenty thousand francs;
for<br>
 by destroying the mould it would become a valuable property. But
one<br>
 of the princes ought to pay thirty or forty thousand francs for
such a<br>
 work to ornament his drawing-room. No man has ever succeeded in
making<br>
 a clock satisfactory alike to the vulgar and to the connoisseur,
and<br>
 this one, sir, solves the difficulty."</p>

<p>"This is for yourself, monsieur," said Hortense, giving six
gold<br>
 pieces to the dealer.</p>

<p>"Never breath a word of this visit to any one living," said
the artist<br>
 to his friend, at the door. "If you should be asked where we
sold the<br>
 group, mention the Duc d'Herouville, the famous collector in the
Rue<br>
 de Varenne."</p>

<p>The dealer nodded assent.</p>

<p>"And your name?" said Hulot to the artist when he came
back.</p>

<p>"Count Steinbock."</p>

<p>"Have you the papers that prove your identity?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Monsieur le Baron. They are in Russian and in German,
but not<br>
 legalized."</p>

<p>"Do you feel equal to undertaking a statue nine feet
high?"</p>

<p>"Yes, monsieur."</p>

<p>"Well, then, if the persons whom I shall consult are satisfied
with<br>
 your work, I can secure you the commission for the statue of
Marshal<br>
 Montcornet, which is to be erected on his monument at
Pere-Lachaise.<br>
 The Minister of War and the old officers of the Imperial Guard
have<br>
 subscribed a sum large enough to enable us to select our
artist."</p>

<p>"Oh, monsieur, it will make my fortune!" exclaimed
Steinbock,<br>
 overpowered by so much happiness at once.</p>

<p>"Be easy," replied the Baron graciously. "If the two ministers
to whom<br>
 I propose to show your group and this sketch in wax are
delighted with<br>
 these two pieces, your prospects of a fortune are good."</p>

<p>Hortense hugged her father's arm so tightly as to hurt
him.</p>

<p>"Bring me your papers, and say nothing of your hopes to
anybody, not<br>
 even to our old Cousin Betty."</p>

<p>"Lisbeth?" said Madame Hulot, at last understanding the end of
all<br>
 this, though unable to guess the means.</p>

<p>"I could give proof of my skill by making a bust of the
Baroness,"<br>
 added Wenceslas.</p>

<p>The artist, struck by Madame Hulot's beauty, was comparing the
mother<br>
 and daughter.</p>

<p>"Indeed, monsieur, life may smile upon you," said the Baron,
quite<br>
 charmed by Count Steinbock's refined and elegant manner. "You
will<br>
 find out that in Paris no man is clever for nothing, and
that<br>
 persevering toil always finds its reward here."</p>

<p>Hortense, with a blush, held out to the young man a pretty
Algerine<br>
 purse containing sixty gold pieces. The artist, with something
still<br>
 of a gentleman's pride, responded with a mounting color easy
enough to<br>
 interpret.</p>

<p>"This, perhaps, is the first money your works have brought
you?" said<br>
 Adeline.</p>

<p>"Yes, madame--my works of art. It is not the first-fruits of
my labor,<br>
 for I have been a workman."</p>

<p>"Well, we must hope my daughter's money will bring you good
luck,"<br>
 said she.</p>

<p>"And take it without scruple," added the Baron, seeing that
Wenceslas<br>
 held the purse in his hand instead of pocketing it. "The sum
will be<br>
 repaid by some rich man, a prince perhaps, who will offer it
with<br>
 interest to possess so fine a work."</p>

<p>"Oh, I want it too much myself, papa, to give it up to anybody
in the<br>
 world, even a royal prince!"</p>

<p>"I can make a far prettier thing than that for you,
mademoiselle."</p>

<p>"But it would not be this one," replied she; and then, as if
ashamed<br>
 of having said too much, she ran out into the garden.</p>

<p>"Then I shall break the mould and the model as soon as I go
home,"<br>
 said Steinbock.</p>

<p>"Fetch me your papers, and you will hear of me before long, if
you are<br>
 equal to what I expect of you, monsieur."</p>

<p>The artist on this could but take leave. After bowing to
Madame Hulot<br>
 and Hortense, who came in from the garden on purpose, he went
off to<br>
 walk in the Tuileries, not bearing--not daring--to return to
his<br>
 attic, where his tyrant would pelt him with questions and wring
his<br>
 secret from him.</p>

<p>Hortense's adorer conceived of groups and statues by the
hundred; he<br>
 felt strong enough to hew the marble himself, like Canova, who
was<br>
 also a feeble man, and nearly died of it. He was transfigured
by<br>
 Hortense, who was to him inspiration made visible.</p>

<p>"Now then," said the Baroness to her daughter, "what does all
this<br>
 mean?"</p>

<p>"Well, dear mamma, you have just seen Cousin Lisbeth's lover,
who now,<br>
 I hope, is mine. But shut your eyes, know nothing. Good Heavens!
I was<br>
 to keep it all from you, and I cannot help telling you
everything----"</p>

<p>"Good-bye, children!" said the Baron, kissing his wife and
daughter;<br>
 "I shall perhaps go to call on the Nanny, and from her I shall
hear a<br>
 great deal about our young man."</p>

<p>"Papa, be cautious!" said Hortense.</p>

<p>"Oh! little girl!" cried the Baroness when Hortense had poured
out her<br>
 poem, of which the morning's adventure was the last canto,
"dear<br>
 little girl, Artlessness will always be the artfulest puss on
earth!"</p>

<p>Genuine passions have an unerring instinct. Set a greedy man
before a<br>
 dish of fruit and he will make no mistake, but take the choicest
even<br>
 without seeing it. In the same way, if you allow a girl who is
well<br>
 brought up to choose a husband for herself, if she is in a
position to<br>
 meet the man of her heart, rarely will she blunder. The act of
nature<br>
 in such cases is known as love at first sight; and in love,
first<br>
 sight is practically second sight.</p>

<p>The Baroness' satisfaction, though disguised under maternal
dignity,<br>
 was as great as her daughter's; for, of the three ways of
marrying<br>
 Hortense of which Crevel had spoken, the best, as she opined,
was<br>
 about to be realized. And she regarded this little drama as an
answer<br>
 by Providence to her fervent prayers.</p>

<p>Mademoiselle Fischer's galley slave, obliged at last to go
home,<br>
 thought he might hide his joy as a lover under his glee as an
artist<br>
 rejoicing over his first success.</p>

<p>"Victory! my group is sold to the Duc d'Herouville, who is
going to<br>
 give me some commissions," cried he, throwing the twelve
hundred<br>
 francs in gold on the table before the old maid.</p>

<p>He had, as may be supposed concealed Hortense's purse; it lay
next to<br>
 his heart.</p>

<p>"And a very good thing too," said Lisbeth. "I was working
myself to<br>
 death. You see, child, money comes in slowly in the business you
have<br>
 taken up, for this is the first you have earned, and you have
been<br>
 grinding at it for near on five years now. That money barely
repays me<br>
 for what you have cost me since I took your promissory note;
that is<br>
 all I have got by my savings. But be sure of one thing," she
said,<br>
 after counting the gold, "this money will all be spent on you.
There<br>
 is enough there to keep us going for a year. In a year you may
now be<br>
 able to pay your debt and have a snug little sum of your own, if
you<br>
 go on in the same way."</p>

<p>Wenceslas, finding his trick successful, expatiated on the
Duc<br>
 d'Herouville.</p>

<p>"I will fit you out in a black suit, and get you some new
linen," said<br>
 Lisbeth, "for you must appear presentably before your patrons;
and<br>
 then you must have a larger and better apartment than your
horrible<br>
 garret, and furnish it property.--You look so bright, you are
not like<br>
 the same creature," she added, gazing at Wenceslas.</p>

<p>"But my work is pronounced a masterpiece."</p>

<p>"Well, so much the better! Do some more," said the arid
creature, who<br>
 was nothing but practical, and incapable of understanding the
joy of<br>
 triumph or of beauty in Art. "Trouble your head no further about
what<br>
 you have sold; make something else to sell. You have spent two
hundred<br>
 francs in money, to say nothing of your time and your labor, on
that<br>
 devil of a <i>Samson</i>. Your clock will cost you more than two
thousand<br>
 francs to execute. I tell you what, if you will listen to me,
you will<br>
 finish the two little boys crowning the little girl with
cornflowers;<br>
 that would just suit the Parisians.--I will go round to Monsieur
Graff<br>
 the tailor before going to Monsieur Crevel.--Go up now and leave
me to<br>
 dress."</p>

<p>Next day the Baron, perfectly crazy about Madame Marneffe,
went to see<br>
 Cousin Betty, who was considerably amazed on opening the door to
see<br>
 who her visitor was, for he had never called on her before. She
at<br>
 once said to herself, "Can it be that Hortense wants my
lover?"--for<br>
 she had heard the evening before, at Monsieur Crevel's, that
the<br>
 marriage with the Councillor of the Supreme Court was broken
off.</p>

<p>"What, Cousin! you here? This is the first time you have ever
been to<br>
 see me, and it is certainly not for love of my fine eyes that
you have<br>
 come now."</p>

<p>"Fine eyes is the truth," said the Baron; "you have as fine
eyes as I<br>
 have ever seen----"</p>

<p>"Come, what are you here for? I really am ashamed to receive
you in<br>
 such a kennel."</p>

<p>The outer room of the two inhabited by Lisbeth served her as
sitting-<br>
 room, dining-room, kitchen, and workroom. The furniture was such
as<br>
 beseemed a well-to-do artisan--walnut-wood chairs with straw
seats, a<br>
 small walnut-wood dining table, a work table, some colored
prints in<br>
 black wooden frames, short muslin curtains to the windows, the
floor<br>
 well polished and shining with cleanliness, not a speck of
dust<br>
 anywhere, but all cold and dingy, like a picture by Terburg in
every<br>
 particular, even to the gray tone given by a wall paper once
blue and<br>
 now faded to gray. As to the bedroom, no human being had
ever<br>
 penetrated its secrets.</p>

<p>The Baron took it all in at a glance, saw the sign-manual
of<br>
 commonness on every detail, from the cast-iron stove to the
household<br>
 utensils, and his gorge rose as he said to himself, "And
<i>this</i> is<br>
 virtue!--What am I here for?" said he aloud. "You are far too
cunning<br>
 not to guess, and I had better tell you plainly," cried he,
sitting<br>
 down and looking out across the courtyard through an opening he
made<br>
 in the puckered curtain. "There is a very pretty woman in
the<br>
 house----"</p>

<p>"Madame Marneffe! Now I understand!" she exclaimed, seeing it
all.<br>
 "But Josepha?"</p>

<p>"Alas, Cousin, Josepha is no more. I was turned out of doors
like a<br>
 discarded footman."</p>

<p>"And you would like . . .?" said Lisbeth, looking at the Baron
with<br>
 the dignity of a prude on her guard a quarter of an hour too
soon.</p>

<p>"As Madame Marneffe is very much the lady, and the wife of an
employe,<br>
 you can meet her without compromising yourself," the Baron went
on,<br>
 "and I should like to see you neighborly. Oh! you need not be
alarmed;<br>
 she will have the greatest consideration for the cousin of
her<br>
 husband's chief."</p>

<p>At this moment the rustle of a gown was heard on the stairs
and the<br>
 footstep of a woman wearing the thinnest boots. The sound ceased
on<br>
 the landing. There was a tap at the door, and Madame Marneffe
came in.</p>

<p>"Pray excuse me, mademoiselle, for thus intruding upon you,
but I<br>
 failed to find you yesterday when I came to call; we are
near<br>
 neighbors; and if I had known that you were related to Monsieur
le<br>
 Baron, I should long since have craved your kind interest with
him. I<br>
 saw him come in, so I took the liberty of coming across; for
my<br>
 husband, Monsieur le Baron, spoke to me of a report on the
office<br>
 clerks which is to be laid before the minister to-morrow."</p>

<p>She seemed quite agitated and nervous--but she had only run
upstairs.</p>

<p>"You have no need to play the petitioner, fair lady," replied
the<br>
 Baron. "It is I who should ask the favor of seeing you."</p>

<p>"Very well, if mademoiselle allows it, pray come!" said
Madame<br>
 Marneffe.</p>

<p>"Yes--go, Cousin, I will join you," said Lisbeth
judiciously.</p>

<p>The Parisienne had so confidently counted on the chief's visit
and<br>
 intelligence, that not only had she dressed herself for so
important<br>
 an interview--she had dressed her room. Early in the day it had
been<br>
 furnished with flowers purchased on credit. Marneffe had helped
his<br>
 wife to polish the furniture, down to the smallest objects,
washing,<br>
 brushing, and dusting everything. Valerie wished to be found in
an<br>
 atmosphere of sweetness, to attract the chief and to please him
enough<br>
 to have a right to be cruel; to tantalize him as a child would,
with<br>
 all the tricks of fashionable tactics. She had gauged Hulot.
Give a<br>
 Paris woman at bay four-and-twenty hours, and she will overthrow
a<br>
 ministry.</p>

<p><br>
 The man of the Empire, accustomed to the ways to the Empire, was
no<br>
 doubt quite ignorant of the ways of modern love-making, of
the<br>
 scruples in vogue and the various styles of conversation
invented<br>
 since 1830, which led to the poor weak woman being regarded as
the<br>
 victim of her lover's desires--a Sister of Charity salving a
wound, an<br>
 angel sacrificing herself.</p>

<p>This modern art of love uses a vast amount of evangelical
phrases in<br>
 the service of the Devil. Passion is martyrdom. Both parties
aspire to<br>
 the Ideal, to the Infinite; love is to make them so much better.
All<br>
 these fine words are but a pretext for putting increased ardor
into<br>
 the practical side of it, more frenzy into a fall than of old.
This<br>
 hypocrisy, a characteristic of the times, is a gangrene in
gallantry.<br>
 The lovers are both angels, and they behave, if they can, like
two<br>
 devils.</p>

<p>Love had no time for such subtle analysis between two
campaigns, and<br>
 in 1809 its successes were as rapid as those of the Empire. So,
under<br>
 the Restoration, the handsome Baron, a lady's man once more, had
begun<br>
 by consoling some old friends now fallen from the political
firmament,<br>
 like extinguished stars, and then, as he grew old, was captured
by<br>
 Jenny Cadine and Josepha.</p>

<p>Madame Marneffe had placed her batteries after due study of
the<br>
 Baron's past life, which her husband had narrated in much
detail,<br>
 after picking up some information in the offices. The comedy of
modern<br>
 sentiment might have the charm of novelty to the Baron; Valerie
had<br>
 made up her mind as to her scheme; and we may say the trial of
her<br>
 power that she made this morning answered her highest
expectations.<br>
 Thanks to her manoeuvres, sentimental, high-flown, and
romantic,<br>
 Valerie, without committing herself to any promises, obtained
for her<br>
 husband the appointment as deputy head of the office and the
Cross of<br>
 the Legion of Honor.</p>

<p>The campaign was not carried out without little dinners at the
<i>Rocher</i><br>
 <i>de Cancale</i>, parties to the play, and gifts in the form of
lace,<br>
 scarves, gowns, and jewelry. The apartment in the Rue du Doyenne
was<br>
 not satisfactory; the Baron proposed to furnish another
magnificently<br>
 in a charming new house in the Rue Vanneau.</p>

<p>Monsieur Marneffe got a fortnight's leave, to be taken a month
hence<br>
 for urgent private affairs in the country, and a present in
money; he<br>
 promised himself that he would spend both in a little town
in<br>
 Switzerland, studying the fair sex.</p>

<p>While Monsieur Hulot thus devoted himself to the lady he
was<br>
 "protecting," he did not forget the young artist. Comte
Popinot,<br>
 Minister of Commerce, was a patron of Art; he paid two thousand
francs<br>
 for a copy of the <i>Samson</i> on condition that the mould
should be<br>
 broken, and that there should be no <i>Samson</i> but his and
Mademoiselle<br>
 Hulot's. The group was admired by a Prince, to whom the model
sketch<br>
 for the clock was also shown, and who ordered it; but that again
was<br>
 to be unique, and he offered thirty thousand francs for it.</p>

<p>Artists who were consulted, and among them Stidmann, were of
opinion<br>
 that the man who had sketched those two models was capable
of<br>
 achieving a statue. The Marshal Prince de Wissembourg, Minister
of<br>
 War, and President of the Committee for the subscriptions to
the<br>
 monument of Marshal Montcornet, called a meeting, at which it
was<br>
 decided that the execution of the work should be placed in
Steinbock's<br>
 hands. The Comte de Rastignac, at that time Under-secretary of
State,<br>
 wished to possess a work by the artist, whose glory was waxing
amid<br>
 the acclamations of his rivals. Steinbock sold to him the
charming<br>
 group of two little boys crowning a little girl, and he promised
to<br>
 secure for the sculptor a studio attached to the Government
marble-<br>
 quarries, situated, as all the world knows, at Le
Gros-Caillou.</p>

<p>This was a success, such success as is won in Paris, that is
to say,<br>
 stupendous success, that crushes those whose shoulders and loins
are<br>
 not strong enough to bear it--as, be it said, not unfrequently
is the<br>
 case. Count Wenceslas Steinbock was written about in all the<br>
 newspapers and reviews without his having the least suspicion of
it,<br>
 any more than had Mademoiselle Fischer. Every day, as soon as
Lisbeth<br>
 had gone out to dinner, Wenceslas went to the Baroness' and
spent an<br>
 hour or two there, excepting on the evenings when Lisbeth dined
with<br>
 the Hulots.</p>

<p>This state of things lasted for several days.</p>

<p>The Baron, assured of Count Steinbock's titles and position;
the<br>
 Baroness, pleased with his character and habits; Hortense, proud
of<br>
 her permitted love and of her suitor's fame, none of them
hesitated to<br>
 speak of the marriage; in short, the artist was in the seventh
heaven,<br>
 when an indiscretion on Madame Marneffe's part spoilt all.</p>

<p>And this was how.</p>

<p>Lisbeth, whom the Baron wished to see intimate with Madame
Marneffe,<br>
 that she might keep an eye on the couple, had already dined
with<br>
 Valerie; and she, on her part, anxious to have an ear in the
Hulot<br>
 house, made much of the old maid. It occurred to Valerie to
invite<br>
 Mademoiselle Fischer to a house-warming in the new apartments
she was<br>
 about to move into. Lisbeth, glad to have found another house to
dine<br>
 in, and bewitched by Madame Marneffe, had taken a great fancy
to<br>
 Valerie. Of all the persons she had made acquaintance with, no
one had<br>
 taken so much pains to please her. In fact, Madame Marneffe,
full of<br>
 attentions for Mademoiselle Fischer, found herself in the
position<br>
 towards Lisbeth that Lisbeth held towards the Baroness,
Monsieur<br>
 Rivet, Crevel, and the others who invited her to dinner.</p>

<p>The Marneffes had excited Lisbeth's compassion by allowing her
to see<br>
 the extreme poverty of the house, while varnishing it as usual
with<br>
 the fairest colors; their friends were under obligations to them
and<br>
 ungrateful; they had had much illness; Madame Fortin, her
mother, had<br>
 never known of their distress, and had died believing herself
wealthy<br>
 to the end, thanks to their superhuman efforts--and so
forth.</p>

<p>"Poor people!" said she to her Cousin Hulot, "you are right to
do what<br>
 you can for them; they are so brave and so kind! They can hardly
live<br>
 on the thousand crowns he gets as deputy-head of the office, for
they<br>
 have got into debt since Marshal Montcornet's death. It is
barbarity<br>
 on the part of the Government to suppose that a clerk with a
wife and<br>
 family can live in Paris on two thousand four hundred francs a
year."</p>

<p>And so, within a very short time, a young woman who affected
regard<br>
 for her, who told her everything, and consulted her, who
flattered<br>
 her, and seemed ready to yield to her guidance, had become
dearer to<br>
 the eccentric Cousin Lisbeth than all her relations.</p>

<p>The Baron, on his part, admiring in Madame Marneffe such
propriety,<br>
 education, and breeding as neither Jenny Cadine nor Josepha, nor
any<br>
 friend of theirs had to show, had fallen in love with her in a
month,<br>
 developing a senile passion, a senseless passion, which had
an<br>
 appearance of reason. In fact, he found here neither the banter,
nor<br>
 the orgies, nor the reckless expenditure, nor the depravity, nor
the<br>
 scorn of social decencies, nor the insolent independence which
had<br>
 brought him to grief alike with the actress and the singer. He
was<br>
 spared, too, the rapacity of the courtesan, like unto the thirst
of<br>
 dry sand.</p>

<p>Madame Marneffe, of whom he had made a friend and confidante,
made the<br>
 greatest difficulties over accepting any gift from him.</p>

<p>"Appointments, official presents, anything you can extract
from the<br>
 Government; but do not begin by insulting a woman whom you
profess to<br>
 love," said Valerie. "If you do, I shall cease to believe
you--and I<br>
 like to believe you," she added, with a glance like Saint
Theresa<br>
 leering at heaven.</p>

<p>Every time he made her a present there was a fortress to be
stormed, a<br>
 conscience to be over-persuaded. The hapless Baron laid deep<br>
 stratagems to offer her some trifle--costly, nevertheless--proud
of<br>
 having at last met with virtue and the realization of his
dreams. In<br>
 this primitive household, as he assured himself, he was the god
as<br>
 much as in his own. And Monsieur Marneffe seemed at a thousand
leagues<br>
 from suspecting that the Jupiter of his office intended to
descend on<br>
 his wife in a shower of gold; he was his august chief's
humblest<br>
 slave.</p>

<p>Madame Marneffe, twenty-three years of age, a pure and bashful
middle-<br>
 class wife, a blossom hidden in the Rue du Doyenne, could know
nothing<br>
 of the depravity and demoralizing harlotry which the Baron could
no<br>
 longer think of without disgust, for he had never known the
charm of<br>
 recalcitrant virtue, and the coy Valerie made him enjoy it to
the<br>
 utmost--all along the line, as the saying goes.</p>

<p>The question having come to this point between Hector and
Valerie, it<br>
 is not astonishing that Valerie should have heard from Hector
the<br>
 secret of the intended marriage between the great sculptor
Steinbock<br>
 and Hortense Hulot. Between a lover on his promotion and a lady
who<br>
 hesitates long before becoming his mistress, there are
contests,<br>
 uttered or unexpressed, in which a word often betrays a thought;
as,<br>
 in fencing, the foils fly as briskly as the swords in duel. Then
a<br>
 prudent man follows the example of Monsieur de Turenne. Thus the
Baron<br>
 had hinted at the greater freedom his daughter's marriage would
allow<br>
 him, in reply to the tender Valerie, who more than once had
exclaimed:</p>

<p>"I cannot imagine how a woman can go wrong for a man who is
not wholly<br>
 hers."</p>

<p>And a thousand times already the Baron had declared that for
five-and-<br>
 twenty years all had been at an end between Madame Hulot and
himself.</p>

<p>"And they say she is so handsome!" replied Madame Marneffe. "I
want<br>
 proof."</p>

<p>"You shall have it," said the Baron, made happy by this
demand, by<br>
 which his Valerie committed herself.</p>

<p>Hector had then been compelled to reveal his plans, already
being<br>
 carried into effect in the Rue Vanneau, to prove to Valerie that
he<br>
 intended to devote to her that half of his life which belonged
to his<br>
 lawful wife, supposing that day and night equally divide the
existence<br>
 of civilized humanity. He spoke of decently deserting his
wife,<br>
 leaving her to herself as soon as Hortense should be married.
The<br>
 Baroness would then spend all her time with Hortense or the
young<br>
 Hulot couple; he was sure of her submission.</p>

<p>"And then, my angel, my true life, my real home will be in the
Rue<br>
 Vanneau."</p>

<p>"Bless me, how you dispose of me!" said Madame Marneffe. "And
my<br>
 husband----"</p>

<p>"That rag!"</p>

<p>"To be sure, as compared with you so he is!" said she with a
laugh.</p>

<p>Madame Marneffe, having heard Steinbock's history, was
frantically<br>
 eager to see the young Count; perhaps she wished to have some
trifle<br>
 of his work while they still lived under the same roof. This
curiosity<br>
 so seriously annoyed the Baron that Valerie swore to him that
she<br>
 would never even look at Wenceslas. But though she obtained, as
the<br>
 reward of her surrender of this wish, a little tea-service of
old<br>
 Sevres <i>pate tendre</i>, she kept her wish at the bottom of
her heart, as<br>
 if written on tablets.</p>

<p>So one day when she had begged "<i>my</i> Cousin Betty" to
come to take<br>
 coffee with her in her room, she opened on the subject of her
lover,<br>
 to know how she might see him without risk.</p>

<p>"My dear child," said she, for they called each my dear, "why
have you<br>
 never introduced your lover to me? Do you know that within a
short<br>
 time he has become famous?"</p>

<p>"He famous?"</p>

<p>"He is the one subject of conversation."</p>

<p>"Pooh!" cried Lisbeth.</p>

<p>"He is going to execute the statue of my father, and I could
be of<br>
 great use to him and help him to succeed in the work; for
Madame<br>
 Montcornet cannot lend him, as I can, a miniature by Sain, a
beautiful<br>
 thing done in 1809, before the Wagram Campaign, and given to my
poor<br>
 mother--Montcornet when he was young and handsome."</p>

<p>Sain and Augustin between them held the sceptre of miniature
painting<br>
 under the Empire.</p>

<p>"He is going to make a statue, my dear, did you say?"</p>

<p>"Nine feet high--by the orders of the Minister of War. Why,
where have<br>
 you dropped from that I should tell you the news? Why, the
Government<br>
 is going to give Count Steinbock rooms and a studio at Le
Gros-<br>
 Caillou, the depot for marble; your Pole will be made the
Director, I<br>
 should not wonder, with two thousand francs a year and a ring on
his<br>
 finger."</p>

<p>"How do you know all this when I have heard nothing about it?"
said<br>
 Lisbeth at last, shaking off her amazement.</p>

<p>"Now, my dear little Cousin Betty," said Madame Marneffe, in
an<br>
 insinuating voice, "are you capable of devoted friendship, put
to any<br>
 test? Shall we henceforth be sisters? Will you swear to me never
to<br>
 have a secret from me any more than I from you--to act as my
spy, as I<br>
 will be yours?--Above all, will you pledge yourself never to
betray me<br>
 either to my husband or to Monsieur Hulot, and never reveal that
it<br>
 was I who told you----?"</p>

<p>Madame Marneffe broke off in this spurring harangue;
Lisbeth<br>
 frightened her. The peasant-woman's face was terrible; her
piercing<br>
 black eyes had the glare of the tiger's; her face was like that
we<br>
 ascribe to a pythoness; she set her teeth to keep them from<br>
 chattering, and her whole frame quivered convulsively. She had
pushed<br>
 her clenched fingers under her cap to clutch her hair and
support her<br>
 head, which felt too heavy; she was on fire. The smoke of the
flame<br>
 that scorched her seemed to emanate from her wrinkles as from
the<br>
 crevasses rent by a volcanic eruption. It was a startling
spectacle.</p>

<p>"Well, why do you stop?" she asked in a hollow voice. "I will
be all<br>
 to you that I have been to him.--Oh, I would have given him my
life-<br>
 blood!"</p>

<p>"You loved him then?"</p>

<p>"Like a child of my own!"</p>

<p>"Well, then," said Madame Marneffe, with a breath of relief,
"if you<br>
 only love him in that way, you will be very happy--for you wish
him to<br>
 be happy?"</p>

<p>Lisbeth replied by a nod as hasty as a madwoman's.</p>

<p>"He is to marry your Cousin Hortense in a month's time."</p>

<p>"Hortense!" shrieked the old maid, striking her forehead, and
starting<br>
 to her feet.</p>

<p>"Well, but then you were really in love with this young man?"
asked<br>
 Valerie.</p>

<p>"My dear, we are bound for life and death, you and I,"
said<br>
 Mademoiselle Fischer. "Yes, if you have any love affairs, to me
they<br>
 are sacred. Your vices will be virtues in my eyes.--For I shall
need<br>
 your vices!"</p>

<p>"Then did you live with him?" asked Valerie.</p>

<p>"No; I meant to be a mother to him."</p>

<p>"I give it up. I cannot understand," said Valerie. "In that
case you<br>
 are neither betrayed nor cheated, and you ought to be very happy
to<br>
 see him so well married; he is now fairly afloat. And, at any
rate,<br>
 your day is over. Our artist goes to Madame Hulot's every
evening as<br>
 soon as you go out to dinner."</p>

<p>"Adeline!" muttered Lisbeth. "Oh, Adeline, you shall pay for
this! I<br>
 will make you uglier than I am."</p>

<p>"You are as pale as death!" exclaimed Valerie. "There is
something<br>
 wrong?--Oh, what a fool I am! The mother and daughter must
have<br>
 suspected that you would raise some obstacles in the way of
this<br>
 affair since they have kept it from you," said Madame Marneffe.
"But<br>
 if you did not live with the young man, my dear, all this is a
greater<br>
 puzzle to me than my husband's feelings----"</p>

<p>"Ah, you don't know," said Lisbeth; "you have no idea of all
their<br>
 tricks. It is the last blow that kills. And how many such blows
have I<br>
 had to bruise my soul! You don't know that from the time when I
could<br>
 first feel, I have been victimized for Adeline. I was beaten,
and she<br>
 was petted; I was dressed like a scullion, and she had clothes
like a<br>
 lady's; I dug in the garden and cleaned the vegetables, and
she--she<br>
 never lifted a finger for anything but to make up some
finery!--She<br>
 married the Baron, she came to shine at the Emperor's Court,
while I<br>
 stayed in our village till 1809, waiting for four years for a
suitable<br>
 match; they brought me away, to be sure, but only to make me a
work-<br>
 woman, and to offer me clerks or captains like coalheavers for
a<br>
 husband! I have had their leavings for twenty-six years!--And
now like<br>
 the story in the Old Testament, the poor relation has one
ewe-lamb<br>
 which is all her joy, and the rich man who has flocks covets the
ewe-<br>
 lamb and steals it--without warning, without asking. Adeline
has<br>
 meanly robbed me of my happiness!--Adeline! Adeline! I will see
you in<br>
 the mire, and sunk lower than myself!--And Hortense--I loved
her, and<br>
 she has cheated me. The Baron.--No, it is impossible. Tell me
again<br>
 what is really true of all this."</p>

<p><br>
 "Be calm, my dear child."</p>

<p>"Valerie, my darling, I will be calm," said the strange
creature,<br>
 sitting down again. "One thing only can restore me to reason;
give me<br>
 proofs."</p>

<p>"Your Cousin Hortense has the <i>Samson</i> group--here is a
lithograph<br>
 from it published in a review. She paid for it out of her
pocket-<br>
 money, and it is the Baron who, to benefit his future
son-in-law, is<br>
 pushing him, getting everything for him."</p>

<p>"Water!--water!" said Lisbeth, after glancing at the print,
below<br>
 which she read, "A group belonging to Mademoiselle Hulot
d'Ervy."<br>
 "Water! my head is burning, I am going mad!"</p>

<p>Madame Marneffe fetched some water. Lisbeth took off her
cap,<br>
 unfastened her black hair, and plunged her head into the basin
her new<br>
 friend held for her. She dipped her forehead into it several
times,<br>
 and checked the incipient inflammation. After this douche
she<br>
 completely recovered her self-command.</p>

<p>"Not a word," said she to Madame Marneffe as she wiped her
face--"not<br>
 a word of all this.--You see, I am quite calm; everything is<br>
 forgotten. I am thinking of something very different."</p>

<p>"She will be in Charenton to-morrow, that is very certain,"
thought<br>
 Madame Marneffe, looking at the old maid.</p>

<p>"What is to be done?" Lisbeth went on. "You see, my angel,
there is<br>
 nothing for it but to hold my tongue, bow my head, and drift to
the<br>
 grave, as all water runs to the river. What could I try to do?
I<br>
 should like to grind them all--Adeline, her daughter, and the
Baron--<br>
 all to dust! But what can a poor relation do against a rich
family? It<br>
 would be the story of the earthen pot and the iron pot."</p>

<p>"Yes; you are right," said Valerie. "You can only pull as much
hay as<br>
 you can to your side of the manger. That is all the upshot of
life in<br>
 Paris."</p>

<p>"Besides," said Lisbeth, "I shall soon die, I can tell you, if
I lose<br>
 that boy to whom I fancied I could always be a mother, and with
whom I<br>
 counted on living all my days----"</p>

<p>There were tears in her eyes, and she paused. Such emotion in
this<br>
 woman made of sulphur and flame, made Valerie shudder.</p>

<p>"Well, at any rate, I have found you," said Lisbeth, taking
Valerie's<br>
 hand, "that is some consolation in this dreadful trouble.--We
shall be<br>
 true friends; and why should we ever part? I shall never cross
your<br>
 track. No one will ever be in love with me!--Those who would
have<br>
 married me, would only have done it to secure my Cousin
Hulot's<br>
 interest. With energy enough to scale Paradise, to have to
devote it<br>
 to procuring bread and water, a few rags, and a garret!--That
is<br>
 martyrdom, my dear, and I have withered under it."</p>

<p>She broke off suddenly, and shot a black flash into Madame
Marneffe's<br>
 blue eyes, a glance that pierced the pretty woman's soul, as the
point<br>
 of a dagger might have pierced her heart.</p>

<p>"And what is the use of talking?" she exclaimed in reproof to
herself.<br>
 "I never said so much before, believe me! The tables will be
turned<br>
 yet!" she added after a pause. "As you so wisely say, let us
sharpen<br>
 our teeth, and pull down all the hay we can get."</p>

<p>"You are very wise," said Madame Marneffe, who had been
frightened by<br>
 this scene, and had no remembrance of having uttered this maxim.
"I am<br>
 sure you are right, my dear child. Life is not so long after
all, and<br>
 we must make the best of it, and make use of others to
contribute to<br>
 our enjoyment. Even I have learned that, young as I am. I was
brought<br>
 up a spoilt child, my father married ambitiously, and almost
forgot<br>
 me, after making me his idol and bringing me up like a
queen's<br>
 daughter! My poor mother, who filled my head with splendid
visions,<br>
 died of grief at seeing me married to an office clerk with
twelve<br>
 hundred francs a year, at nine-and-thirty an aged and
hardened<br>
 libertine, as corrupt as the hulks, looking on me, as others
looked on<br>
 you, as a means of fortune!--Well, in that wretched man, I have
found<br>
 the best of husbands. He prefers the squalid sluts he picks up
at the<br>
 street corners, and leaves me free. Though he keeps all his
salary to<br>
 himself, he never asks me where I get money to live on----"</p>

<p>And she in her turn stopped short, as a woman does who feels
herself<br>
 carried away by the torrent of her confessions; struck, too,
by<br>
 Lisbeth's eager attention, she thought well to make sure of
Lisbeth<br>
 before revealing her last secrets.</p>

<p>"You see, dear child, how entire is my confidence in you!"
she<br>
 presently added, to which Lisbeth replied by a most comforting
nod.</p>

<p>An oath may be taken by a look and a nod more solemnly than in
a court<br>
 of justice.</p>

<p>"I keep up every appearance of respectability," Valerie went
on,<br>
 laying her hand on Lisbeth's as if to accept her pledge. "I am
a<br>
 married woman, and my own mistress, to such a degree, that in
the<br>
 morning, when Marneffe sets out for the office, if he takes it
into<br>
 his head to say good-bye and finds my door locked, he goes off
without<br>
 a word. He cares less for his boy than I care for one of the
marble<br>
 children that play at the feet of one of the river-gods in
the<br>
 Tuileries. If I do not come home to dinner, he dines quite
contentedly<br>
 with the maid, for the maid is devoted to monsieur; and he goes
out<br>
 every evening after dinner, and does not come in till twelve or
one<br>
 o'clock. Unfortunately, for a year past, I have had no ladies'
maid,<br>
 which is as much as to say that I am a widow!</p>

<p>"I have had one passion, once have been happy--a rich
Brazilian--who<br>
 went away a year ago--my only lapse!--He went away to sell
his<br>
 estates, to realize his land, and come back to live in France.
What<br>
 will he find left of his Valerie? A dunghill. Well! it is his
fault<br>
 and not mine; why does he delay coming so long? Perhaps he has
been<br>
 wrecked--like my virtue."</p>

<p>"Good-bye, my dear," said Lisbeth abruptly; "we are friends
for ever.<br>
 I love you, I esteem you, I am wholly yours! My cousin is
tormenting<br>
 me to go and live in the house you are moving to, in the Rue
Vanneau;<br>
 but I would not go, for I saw at once the reasons for this fresh
piece<br>
 of kindness----"</p>

<p>"Yes; you would have kept an eye on me, I know!" said Madame
Marneffe.</p>

<p>"That was, no doubt, the motive of his generosity," replied
Lisbeth.<br>
 "In Paris, most beneficence is a speculation, as most acts
of<br>
 ingratitude are revenge! To a poor relation you behave as you do
to<br>
 rats to whom you offer a bit of bacon. Now, I will accept the
Baron's<br>
 offer, for this house has grown intolerable to me. You and I
have wit<br>
 enough to hold our tongues about everything that would damage
us, and<br>
 tell all that needs telling. So, no blabbing--and we are
friends."</p>

<p>"Through thick and thin!" cried Madame Marneffe, delighted to
have a<br>
 sheep-dog, a confidante, a sort of respectable aunt. "Listen to
me;<br>
 the Baron is doing a great deal in the Rue Vanneau----"</p>

<p>"I believe you!" interrupted Lisbeth. "He has spent thirty
thousand<br>
 francs! Where he got the money, I am sure I don't know, for
Josepha<br>
 the singer bled him dry.--Oh! you are in luck," she went on.
"The<br>
 Baron would steal for a woman who held his heart in two little
white<br>
 satin hands like yours!"</p>

<p>"Well, then," said Madame Marneffe, with the liberality of
such<br>
 creatures, which is mere recklessness, "look here, my dear
child; take<br>
 away from here everything that may serve your turn in your
new<br>
 quarters--that chest of drawers, that wardrobe and mirror, the
carpet,<br>
 the curtains----"</p>

<p>Lisbeth's eyes dilated with excessive joy; she was incredulous
of such<br>
 a gift.</p>

<p>"You are doing more for me in a breath than my rich relations
have<br>
 done in thirty years!" she exclaimed. "They have never even
asked<br>
 themselves whether I had any furniture at all. On his first
visit, a<br>
 few weeks ago, the Baron made a rich man's face on seeing how
poor I<br>
 was.--Thank you, my dear; and I will give you your money's
worth, you<br>
 will see how by and by."</p>

<p>Valerie went out on the landing with <i>her</i> Cousin Betty,
and the two<br>
 women embraced.</p>

<p>"Pouh! How she stinks of hard work!" said the pretty little
woman to<br>
 herself when she was alone. "I shall not embrace you often, my
dear<br>
 cousin! At the same time, I must look sharp. She must be
skilfully<br>
 managed, for she can be of use, and help me to make my
fortune."</p>

<p>Like the true Creole of Paris, Madame Marneffe abhorred
trouble; she<br>
 had the calm indifference of a cat, which never jumps or runs
but when<br>
 urged by necessity. To her, life must be all pleasure; and
the<br>
 pleasure without difficulties. She loved flowers, provided they
were<br>
 brought to her. She could not imagine going to the play but to a
good<br>
 box, at her own command, and in a carriage to take her there.
Valerie<br>
 inherited these courtesan tastes from her mother, on whom
General<br>
 Montcornet had lavished luxury when he was in Paris, and who
for<br>
 twenty years had seen all the world at her feet; who had been
wasteful<br>
 and prodigal, squandering her all in the luxurious living of
which the<br>
 programme has been lost since the fall of Napoleon.</p>

<p>The grandees of the Empire were a match in their follies for
the great<br>
 nobles of the last century. Under the Restoration the nobility
cannot<br>
 forget that it has been beaten and robbed, and so, with two or
three<br>
 exceptions, it has become thrifty, prudent, and stay-at-home,
in<br>
 short, bourgeois and penurious. Since then, 1830 has crowned the
work<br>
 of 1793. In France, henceforth, there will be great names, but
no<br>
 great houses, unless there should be political changes which we
can<br>
 hardly foresee. Everything takes the stamp of individuality.
The<br>
 wisest invest in annuities. Family pride is destroyed.</p>

<p>The bitter pressure of poverty which had stung Valerie to the
quick on<br>
 the day when, to use Marneffe's expression, she had "caught on"
with<br>
 Hulot, had brought the young woman to the conclusion that she
would<br>
 make a fortune by means of her good looks. So, for some days,
she had<br>
 been feeling the need of having a friend about her to take the
place<br>
 of a mother--a devoted friend, to whom such things may be told
as must<br>
 be hidden from a waiting-maid, and who could act, come and go,
and<br>
 think for her, a beast of burden resigned to an unequal share of
life.<br>
 Now, she, quite as keenly as Lisbeth, had understood the
Baron's<br>
 motives for fostering the intimacy between his cousin and
herself.</p>

<p>Prompted by the formidable perspicacity of the Parisian
half-breed,<br>
 who spends her days stretched on a sofa, turning the lantern of
her<br>
 detective spirit on the obscurest depths of souls, sentiments,
and<br>
 intrigues, she had decided on making an ally of the spy.
This<br>
 supremely rash step was, perhaps premeditated; she had discerned
the<br>
 true nature of this ardent creature, burning with wasted
passion, and<br>
 meant to attach her to herself. Thus, their conversation was
like the<br>
 stone a traveler casts into an abyss to demonstrate its depth.
And<br>
 Madame Marneffe had been terrified to find this old maid a
combination<br>
 of Iago and Richard III., so feeble as she seemed, so humble,
and so<br>
 little to be feared.</p>

<p>For that instant, Lisbeth Fischer had been her real self;
that<br>
 Corsican and savage temperament, bursting the slender bonds that
held<br>
 it under, had sprung up to its terrible height, as the branch of
a<br>
 tree flies up from the hand of a child that has bent it down to
gather<br>
 the green fruit.</p>

<p>To those who study the social world, it must always be a
matter of<br>
 astonishment to see the fulness, the perfection, and the
rapidity with<br>
 which an idea develops in a virgin nature.</p>

<p>Virginity, like every other monstrosity, has its special
richness, its<br>
 absorbing greatness. Life, whose forces are always economized,
assumes<br>
 in the virgin creature an incalculable power of resistance
and<br>
 endurance. The brain is reinforced in the sum-total of its
reserved<br>
 energy. When really chaste natures need to call on the resources
of<br>
 body or soul, and are required to act or to think, they have
muscles<br>
 of steel, or intuitive knowledge in their
intelligence--diabolical<br>
 strength, or the black magic of the Will.</p>

<p>From this point of view the Virgin Mary, even if we regard her
only as<br>
 a symbol, is supremely great above every other type, whether
Hindoo,<br>
 Egyptian, or Greek. Virginity, the mother of great things,
<i>magna</i><br>
 <i>parens rerum</i>, holds in her fair white hands the keys of
the upper<br>
 worlds. In short, that grand and terrible exception deserves all
the<br>
 honors decreed to her by the Catholic Church.</p>

<p>Thus, in one moment, Lisbeth Fischer had become the Mohican
whose<br>
 snares none can escape, whose dissimulation is inscrutable,
whose<br>
 swift decisiveness is the outcome of the incredible perfection
of<br>
 every organ of sense. She was Hatred and Revenge, as implacable
as<br>
 they are in Italy, Spain, and the East. These two feelings,
the<br>
 obverse of friendship and love carried to the utmost, are known
only<br>
 in lands scorched by the sun. But Lisbeth was also a daughter
of<br>
 Lorraine, bent on deceit.</p>

<p>She accepted this detail of her part against her will; she
began by<br>
 making a curious attempt, due to her ignorance. She fancied,
as<br>
 children do, that being imprisoned meant the same thing as
solitary<br>
 confinement. But this is the superlative degree of imprisonment,
and<br>
 that superlative is the privilege of the Criminal Bench.</p>

<p>As soon as she left Madame Marneffe, Lisbeth hurried off to
Monsieur<br>
 Rivet, and found him in his office.</p>

<p>"Well, my dear Monsieur Rivet," she began, when she had bolted
the<br>
 door of the room. "You were quite right. Those Poles! They are
low<br>
 villains--all alike, men who know neither law nor fidelity."</p>

<p>"And who want to set Europe on fire," said the peaceable
Rivet, "to<br>
 ruin every trade and every trader for the sake of a country that
is<br>
 all bog-land, they say, and full of horrible Jews, to say
nothing of<br>
 the Cossacks and the peasants--a sort of wild beasts classed
by<br>
 mistake with human beings. Your Poles do not understand the
times we<br>
 live in; we are no longer barbarians. War is coming to an end,
my dear<br>
 mademoiselle; it went out with the Monarchy. This is the age
of<br>
 triumph for commerce, and industry, and middle-class prudence,
such as<br>
 were the making of Holland.</p>

<p>"Yes," he went on with animation, "we live in a period when
nations<br>
 must obtain all they need by the legal extension of their
liberties<br>
 and by the pacific action of Constitutional Institutions; that
is what<br>
 the Poles do not see, and I hope----</p>

<p>"You were saying, my dear?--" he added, interrupting himself
when he<br>
 saw from his work-woman's face that high politics were beyond
her<br>
 comprehension.</p>

<p>"Here is the schedule," said Lisbeth. "If I don't want to lose
my<br>
 three thousand two hundred and ten francs, I must clap this
rogue into<br>
 prison."</p>

<p>"Didn't I tell you so?" cried the oracle of the Saint-Denis
quarter.</p>

<p>The Rivets, successor to Pons Brothers, had kept their shop
still in<br>
 the Rue des Mauvaises-Paroles, in the ancient Hotel Langeais,
built by<br>
 that illustrious family at the time when the nobility still
gathered<br>
 round the Louvre.</p>

<p>"Yes, and I blessed you on my way here," replied Lisbeth.</p>

<p>"If he suspects nothing, he can be safe in prison by eight
o'clock in<br>
 the morning," said Rivet, consulting the almanac to ascertain
the hour<br>
 of sunrise; "but not till the day after to-morrow, for he cannot
be<br>
 imprisoned till he has had notice that he is to be arrested by
writ,<br>
 with the option of payment or imprisonment. And so----"</p>

<p>"What an idiotic law!" exclaimed Lisbeth. "Of course the
debtor<br>
 escapes."</p>

<p>"He has every right to do so," said the Assessor, smiling. "So
this is<br>
 the way----"</p>

<p>"As to that," said Lisbeth, interrupting him, "I will take the
paper<br>
 and hand it to him, saying that I have been obliged to raise
the<br>
 money, and that the lender insists on this formality. I know
my<br>
 gentleman. He will not even look at the paper; he will light his
pipe<br>
 with it."</p>

<p>"Not a bad idea, not bad, Mademoiselle Fischer! Well, make
your mind<br>
 easy; the job shall be done.--But stop a minute; to put your man
in<br>
 prison is not the only point to be considered; you only want
to<br>
 indulge in that legal luxury in order to get your money. Who is
to pay<br>
 you?"</p>

<p>"Those who give him money."</p>

<p>"To be sure; I forgot that the Minister of War had
commissioned him to<br>
 erect a monument to one of our late customers. Ah! the house
has<br>
 supplied many an uniform to General Montcornet; he soon
blackened them<br>
 with the smoke of cannon. A brave man, he was! and he paid on
the<br>
 nail."</p>

<p>A marshal of France may have saved the Emperor or his country;
"He<br>
 paid on the nail" will always be the highest praise he can have
from a<br>
 tradesman.</p>

<p>"Very well. And on Saturday, Monsieur Rivet, you shall have
the flat<br>
 tassels.--By the way, I am moving from the Rue du Doyenne; I am
going<br>
 to live in the Rue Vanneau."</p>

<p>"You are very right. I could not bear to see you in that hole
which,<br>
 in spite of my aversion to the Opposition, I must say is a
disgrace; I<br>
 repeat it, yes! is a disgrace to the Louvre and the Place du<br>
 Carrousel. I am devoted to Louis-Philippe, he is my idol; he is
the<br>
 august and exact representative of the class on whom he founded
his<br>
 dynasty, and I can never forget what he did for the
trimming-makers by<br>
 restoring the National Guard----"</p>

<p>"When I hear you speak so, Monsieur Rivet, I cannot help
wondering why<br>
 you are not made a deputy."</p>

<p>"They are afraid of my attachment to the dynasty," replied
Rivet. "My<br>
 political enemies are the King's. He has a noble character! They
are a<br>
 fine family; in short," said he, returning to the charge, "he is
our<br>
 ideal: morality, economy, everything. But the completion of the
Louvre<br>
 is one of the conditions on which we gave him the crown, and the
civil<br>
 list, which, I admit, had no limits set to it, leaves the heart
of<br>
 Paris in a most melancholy state.--It is because I am so
strongly in<br>
 favor of the middle course that I should like to see the middle
of<br>
 Paris in a better condition. Your part of the town is
positively<br>
 terrifying. You would have been murdered there one fine
day.--And so<br>
 your Monsieur Crevel has been made Major of his division! He
will come<br>
 to us, I hope, for his big epaulette."</p>

<p>"I am dining with him to-night, and will send him to you."</p>

<p>Lisbeth believed that she had secured her Livonian to herself
by<br>
 cutting him off from all communication with the outer world. If
he<br>
 could no longer work, the artist would be forgotten as
completely as a<br>
 man buried in a cellar, where she alone would go to see him.
Thus she<br>
 had two happy days, for she hoped to deal a mortal blow at
the<br>
 Baroness and her daughter.</p>

<p>To go to Crevel's house, in the Rue des Saussayes, she crossed
the<br>
 Pont du Carrousel, went along the Quai Voltaire, the Quai
d'Orsay, the<br>
 Rue Bellechasse, Rue de l'Universite, the Pont de la Concorde,
and the<br>
 Avenue de Marigny. This illogical route was traced by the logic
of<br>
 passion, always the foe of the legs.</p>

<p>Cousin Betty, as long as she followed the line of the quays,
kept<br>
 watch on the opposite shore of the Seine, walking very slowly.
She had<br>
 guessed rightly. She had left Wenceslas dressing; she at
once<br>
 understood that, as soon as he should be rid of her, the lover
would<br>
 go off to the Baroness' by the shortest road. And, in fact, as
she<br>
 wandered along by the parapet of the Quai Voltaire, in fancy<br>
 suppressing the river and walking along the opposite bank,
she<br>
 recognized the artist as he came out of the Tuileries to cross
the<br>
 Pont Royal. She there came up with the faithless one, and could
follow<br>
 him unseen, for lovers rarely look behind them. She escorted him
as<br>
 far as Madame Hulot's house, where he went in like an
accustomed<br>
 visitor.</p>

<p>This crowning proof, confirming Madame Marneffe's revelations,
put<br>
 Lisbeth quite beside herself.</p>

<p>She arrived at the newly promoted Major's door in the state of
mental<br>
 irritation which prompts men to commit murder, and found
Monsieur<br>
 Crevel <i>senior</i> in his drawing-room awaiting his children,
Monsieur<br>
 and Madame Hulot <i>junior</i>.</p>

<p>But Celestin Crevel was so unconscious and so perfect a type
of the<br>
 Parisian parvenu, that we can scarcely venture so
unceremoniously into<br>
 the presence of Cesar Birotteau's successor. Celestin Crevel was
a<br>
 world in himself; and he, even more than Rivet, deserves the
honors of<br>
 the palette by reason of his importance in this domestic
drama.</p>

<p>Have you ever observed how in childhood, or at the early
stages of<br>
 social life, we create a model for our own imitation, with our
own<br>
 hands as it were, and often without knowing it? The banker's
clerk,<br>
 for instance, as he enters his master's drawing-room, dreams
of<br>
 possessing such another. If he makes a fortune, it will not be
the<br>
 luxury of the day, twenty years later, that you will find in
his<br>
 house, but the old-fashioned splendor that fascinated him of
yore. It<br>
 is impossible to tell how many absurdities are due to this<br>
 retrospective jealousy; and in the same way we know nothing of
the<br>
 follies due to the covert rivalry that urges men to copy the
type they<br>
 have set themselves, and exhaust their powers in shining with
a<br>
 reflected light, like the moon.</p>

<p>Crevel was deputy mayor because his predecessor had been; he
was Major<br>
 because he coveted Cesar Birotteau's epaulettes. In the same
way,<br>
 struck by the marvels wrought by Grindot the architect, at the
time<br>
 when Fortune had carried his master to the top of the wheel,
Crevel<br>
 had "never looked at both sides of a crown-piece," to use his
own<br>
 language, when he wanted to "do up" his rooms; he had gone with
his<br>
 purse open and his eyes shut to Grindot, who by this time was
quite<br>
 forgotten. It is impossible to guess how long an extinct
reputation<br>
 may survive, supported by such stale admiration.</p>

<p>So Grindot, for the thousandth time had displayed his
white-and-gold<br>
 drawing-room paneled with crimson damask. The furniture, of
rosewood,<br>
 clumsily carved, as such work is done for the trade, had in
the<br>
 country been the source of just pride in Paris workmanship on
the<br>
 occasion of an industrial exhibition. The candelabra, the
fire-dogs,<br>
 the fender, the chandelier, the clock, were all in the most
unmeaning<br>
 style of scroll-work; the round table, a fixture in the middle
of the<br>
 room, was a mosaic of fragments of Italian and antique
marbles,<br>
 brought from Rome, where these dissected maps are made of<br>
 mineralogical specimens--for all the world like tailors'
patterns--an<br>
 object of perennial admiration to Crevel's citizen friends.
The<br>
 portraits of the late lamented Madame Crevel, of Crevel himself,
of<br>
 his daughter and his son-in-law, hung on the walls, two and two;
they<br>
 were the work of Pierre Grassou, the favored painter of the<br>
 bourgeoisie, to whom Crevel owed his ridiculous Byronic
attitude. The<br>
 frames, costing a thousand francs each, were quite in harmony
with<br>
 this coffee-house magnificence, which would have made any true
artist<br>
 shrug his shoulders.</p>

<p><br>
 Money never yet missed the smallest opportunity of being stupid.
We<br>
 should have in Paris ten Venices if our retired merchants had
had the<br>
 instinct for fine things characteristic of the Italians. Even in
our<br>
 own day a Milanese merchant could leave five hundred thousand
francs<br>
 to the Duomo, to regild the colossal statue of the Virgin that
crowns<br>
 the edifice. Canova, in his will, desired his brother to build
a<br>
 church costing four million francs, and that brother adds
something on<br>
 his own account. Would a citizen of Paris--and they all, like
Rivet,<br>
 love their Paris in their heart--ever dream of building the
spires<br>
 that are lacking to the towers of Notre-Dame? And only think of
the<br>
 sums that revert to the State in property for which no heirs
are<br>
 found.</p>

<p>All the improvements of Paris might have been completed with
the money<br>
 spent on stucco castings, gilt mouldings, and sham sculpture
during<br>
 the last fifteen years by individuals of the Crevel stamp.</p>

<p>Beyond this drawing-room was a splendid boudoir furnished with
tables<br>
 and cabinets in imitation of Boulle.</p>

<p>The bedroom, smart with chintz, also opened out of the
drawing-room.<br>
 Mahogany in all its glory infested the dining-room, and Swiss
views,<br>
 gorgeously framed, graced the panels. Crevel, who hoped to
travel in<br>
 Switzerland, had set his heart on possessing the scenery in
painting<br>
 till the time should come when he might see it in reality.</p>

<p>So, as will have been seen, Crevel, the Mayor's deputy, of the
Legion<br>
 of Honor and of the National Guard, had faithfully reproduced
all the<br>
 magnificence, even as to furniture, of his luckless predecessor.
Under<br>
 the Restoration, where one had sunk, this other, quite
overlooked, had<br>
 come to the top--not by any strange stroke of fortune, but by
the<br>
 force of circumstance. In revolutions, as in storms at sea,
solid<br>
 treasure goes to the bottom, and light trifles are floated to
the<br>
 surface. Cesar Birotteau, a Royalist, in favor and envied, had
been<br>
 made the mark of bourgeois hostility, while bourgeoisie
triumphant<br>
 found its incarnation in Crevel.</p>

<p>This apartment, at a rent of a thousand crowns, crammed with
all the<br>
 vulgar magnificence that money can buy, occupied the first floor
of a<br>
 fine old house between a courtyard and a garden. Everything was
as<br>
 spick-and-span as the beetles in an entomological case, for
Crevel<br>
 lived very little at home.</p>

<p>This gorgeous residence was the ambitious citizen's legal
domicile.<br>
 His establishment consisted of a woman-cook and a valet; he
hired two<br>
 extra men, and had a dinner sent in by Chevet, whenever he gave
a<br>
 banquet to his political friends, to men he wanted to dazzle or
to a<br>
 family party.</p>

<p>The seat of Crevel's real domesticity, formerly in the Rue
Notre-Dame<br>
 de Lorette, with Mademoiselle Heloise Brisetout, had lately
been<br>
 transferred, as we have seen, to the Rue Chauchat. Every morning
the<br>
 retired merchant--every ex-tradesman is a retired
merchant--spent two<br>
 hours in the Rue des Saussayes to attend to business, and gave
the<br>
 rest of his time to Mademoiselle Zaire, which annoyed Zaire very
much.<br>
 Orosmanes-Crevel had a fixed bargain with Mademoiselle Heloise;
she<br>
 owed him five hundred francs worth of enjoyment every month, and
no<br>
 "bills delivered." He paid separately for his dinner and all
extras.<br>
 This agreement, with certain bonuses, for he made her a good
many<br>
 presents, seemed cheap to the ex-attache of the great singer;
and he<br>
 would say to widowers who were fond of their daughters, that it
paid<br>
 better to job your horses than to have a stable of your own. At
the<br>
 same time, if the reader remembers the speech made to the Baron
by the<br>
 porter at the Rue Chauchat, Crevel did not escape the coachman
and the<br>
 groom.</p>

<p>Crevel, as may be seen, had turned his passionate affection
for his<br>
 daughter to the advantage of his self-indulgence. The immoral
aspect<br>
 of the situation was justified by the highest morality. And then
the<br>
 ex-perfumer derived from this style of living--it was the
inevitable,<br>
 a free-and-easy life, <i>Regence, Pompadour, Marechal de
Richelieu</i>,<br>
 what not--a certain veneer of superiority. Crevel set up for
being a<br>
 man of broad views, a fine gentleman with an air and grace, a
liberal<br>
 man with nothing narrow in his ideas--and all for the small sum
of<br>
 about twelve to fifteen hundred francs a month. This was the
result<br>
 not of hypocritical policy, but of middle-class vanity, though
it came<br>
 to the same in the end.</p>

<p>On the Bourse Crevel was regarded as a man superior to his
time, and<br>
 especially as a man of pleasure, a <i>bon vivant</i>. In this
particular<br>
 Crevel flattered himself that he had overtopped his worthy
friend<br>
 Birotteau by a hundred cubits.</p>

<p>"And is it you?" cried Crevel, flying into a rage as he saw
Lisbeth<br>
 enter the room, "who have plotted this marriage between
Mademoiselle<br>
 Hulot and your young Count, whom you have been bringing up by
hand for<br>
 her?"</p>

<p>"You don't seem best pleased at it?" said Lisbeth, fixing a
piercing<br>
 eye on Crevel. "What interest can you have in hindering my
cousin's<br>
 marriage? For it was you, I am told, who hindered her
marrying<br>
 Monsieur Lebas' son."</p>

<p>"You are a good soul and to be trusted," said Crevel. "Well,
then, do<br>
 you suppose that I will ever forgive Monsieur Hulot for the
crime of<br>
 having robbed me of Josepha--especially when he turned a decent
girl,<br>
 whom I should have married in my old age, into a
good-for-nothing<br>
 slut, a mountebank, an opera singer!--No, no. Never!"</p>

<p>"He is a very good fellow, too, is Monsieur Hulot," said
Cousin Betty.</p>

<p>"Amiable, very amiable--too amiable," replied Crevel. "I wish
him no<br>
 harm; but I do wish to have my revenge, and I will have it. It
is my<br>
 one idea."</p>

<p>"And is that desire the reason why you no longer visit Madame
Hulot?"</p>

<p>"Possibly."</p>

<p>"Ah, ha! then you were courting my fair cousin?" said Lisbeth,
with a<br>
 smile. "I thought as much."</p>

<p>"And she treated me like a dog!--worse, like a footman; nay, I
might<br>
 say like a political prisoner.--But I will succeed yet," said
he,<br>
 striking his brow with his clenched fist.</p>

<p>"Poor man! It would be dreadful to catch his wife deceiving
him after<br>
 being packed off by his mistress."</p>

<p>"Josepha?" cried Crevel. "Has Josepha thrown him over, packed
him off,<br>
 turned him out neck and crop? Bravo, Josepha, you have avenged
me! I<br>
 will send you a pair of pearls to hang in your ears, my
ex-sweetheart!<br>
 --I knew nothing of it; for after I had seen you, on the day
after<br>
 that when the fair Adeline had shown me the door, I went back to
visit<br>
 the Lebas, at Corbeil, and have but just come back. Heloise
played the<br>
 very devil to get me into the country, and I have found out
the<br>
 purpose of her game; she wanted me out of the way while she gave
a<br>
 house-warming in the Rue Chauchat, with some artists, and
players, and<br>
 writers.--She took me in! But I can forgive her, for Heloise
amuses<br>
 me. She is a Dejazet under a bushel. What a character the hussy
is!<br>
 There is the note I found last evening:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>" 'DEAR OLD CHAP,--I have pitched my tent in the Rue Chauchat.
I<br>
 have taken the precaution of getting a few friends to clean up
the<br>
 paint. All is well. Come when you please, monsieur; Hagar
awaits<br>
 her Abraham.'</p>
</blockquote>

<p>"Heloise will have some news for me, for she has her bohemia
at her<br>
 fingers' end."</p>

<p>"But Monsieur Hulot took the disaster very calmly," said
Lisbeth.</p>

<p>"Impossible!" cried Crevel, stopping in a parade as regular as
the<br>
 swing of a pendulum.</p>

<p>"Monsieur Hulot is not as young as he was," Lisbeth
remarked<br>
 significantly.</p>

<p><br>
 "I know that," said Crevel, "but in one point we are alike:
Hulot<br>
 cannot do without an attachment. He is capable of going back to
his<br>
 wife. It would be a novelty for him, but an end to my vengeance.
You<br>
 smile, Mademoiselle Fischer--ah! perhaps you know
something?"</p>

<p>"I am smiling at your notions," replied Lisbeth. "Yes, my
cousin is<br>
 still handsome enough to inspire a passion. I should certainly
fall in<br>
 love with her if I were a man."</p>

<p>"Cut and come again!" exclaimed Crevel. "You are laughing at
me.--The<br>
 Baron has already found consolation?"</p>

<p>Lisbeth bowed affirmatively.</p>

<p>"He is a lucky man if he can find a second Josepha within
twenty-four<br>
 hours!" said Crevel. "But I am not altogether surprised, for he
told<br>
 me one evening at supper that when he was a young man he always
had<br>
 three mistresses on hand that he might not be left high and
dry--the<br>
 one he was giving over, the one in possession, and the one he
was<br>
 courting for a future emergency. He had some smart little
work-woman<br>
 in reserve, no doubt--in his fish-pond--his
<i>Parc-aux-cerfs</i>! He is<br>
 very Louis XV., is my gentleman. He is in luck to be so
handsome!--<br>
 However, he is ageing; his face shows it.--He has taken up with
some<br>
 little milliner?"</p>

<p>"Dear me, no," replied Lisbeth.</p>

<p>"Oh!" cried Crevel, "what would I not do to hinder him from
hanging up<br>
 his hat! I could not win back Josepha; women of that kind never
come<br>
 back to their first love.--Besides, it is truly said, such a
return is<br>
 not love.--But, Cousin Betty, I would pay down fifty thousand
francs--<br>
 that is to say, I would spend it--to rob that great
good-looking<br>
 fellow of his mistress, and to show him that a Major with a
portly<br>
 stomach and a brain made to become Mayor of Paris, though he is
a<br>
 grandfather, is not to have his mistress tickled away by a
poacher<br>
 without turning the tables."</p>

<p>"My position," said Lisbeth, "compels me to hear everything
and know<br>
 nothing. You may talk to me without fear; I never repeat a word
of<br>
 what any one may choose to tell me. How can you suppose I should
ever<br>
 break that rule of conduct? No one would ever trust me
again."</p>

<p>"I know," said Crevel; "you are the very jewel of old maids.
Still,<br>
 come, there are exceptions. Look here, the family have never
settled<br>
 an allowance on you?"</p>

<p>"But I have my pride," said Lisbeth. "I do not choose to be an
expense<br>
 to anybody."</p>

<p>"If you will but help me to my revenge," the tradesman went
on, "I<br>
 will sink ten thousand francs in an annuity for you. Tell me, my
fair<br>
 cousin, tell me who has stepped into Josepha's shoes, and you
will<br>
 have money to pay your rent, your little breakfast in the
morning, the<br>
 good coffee you love so well--you might allow yourself pure
Mocha,<br>
 heh! And a very good thing is pure Mocha!"</p>

<p>"I do not care so much for the ten thousand francs in an
annuity,<br>
 which would bring me nearly five hundred francs a year, as
for<br>
 absolute secrecy," said Lisbeth. "For, you see, my dear
Monsieur<br>
 Crevel, the Baron is very good to me; he is to pay my
rent----"</p>

<p>"Oh yes, long may that last! I advise you to trust him," cried
Crevel.<br>
 "Where will he find the money?"</p>

<p>"Ah, that I don't know. At the same time, he is spending more
than<br>
 thirty thousand francs on the rooms he is furnishing for this
little<br>
 lady."</p>

<p>"A lady! What, a woman in society; the rascal, what luck he
has! He is<br>
 the only favorite!"</p>

<p>"A married woman, and quite the lady," Lisbeth affirmed.</p>

<p>"Really and truly?" cried Crevel, opening wide eyes flashing
with<br>
 envy, quite as much as at the magic words <i>quite the
lady</i>.</p>

<p>"Yes, really," said Lisbeth. "Clever, a musician,
three-and-twenty, a<br>
 pretty, innocent face, a dazzling white skin, teeth like a
puppy's,<br>
 eyes like stars, a beautiful forehead--and tiny feet, I never
saw the<br>
 like, they are not wider than her stay-busk."</p>

<p>"And ears?" asked Crevel, keenly alive to this catalogue of
charms.</p>

<p>"Ears for a model," she replied.</p>

<p>"And small hands?"</p>

<p>"I tell you, in few words, a gem of a woman--and high-minded,
and<br>
 modest, and refined! A beautiful soul, an angel--and with
every<br>
 distinction, for her father was a Marshal of France----"</p>

<p>"A Marshal of France!" shrieked Crevel, positively bounding
with<br>
 excitement. "Good Heavens! by the Holy Piper! By all the joys
in<br>
 Paradise!--The rascal!--I beg your pardon, Cousin, I am going
crazy!--<br>
 I think I would give a hundred thousand francs----"</p>

<p>"I dare say you would, and, I tell you, she is a respectable
woman--a<br>
 woman of virtue. The Baron has forked out handsomely."</p>

<p>"He has not a sou, I tell you."</p>

<p>"There is a husband he has pushed----"</p>

<p>"Where did he push him?" asked Crevel, with a bitter
laugh.</p>

<p>"He is promoted to be second in his office--this husband who
will<br>
 oblige, no doubt;--and his name is down for the Cross of the
Legion of<br>
 Honor."</p>

<p>"The Government ought to be judicious and respect those who
have the<br>
 Cross by not flinging it broadcast," said Crevel, with the look
of an<br>
 aggrieved politician. "But what is there about the man--that
old<br>
 bulldog of a Baron?" he went on. "It seems to me that I am quite
a<br>
 match for him," and he struck an attitude as he looked at
himself in<br>
 the glass. "Heloise has told me many a time, at moments when a
woman<br>
 speaks the truth, that I was wonderful."</p>

<p>"Oh," said Lisbeth, "women like big men; they are almost
always good-<br>
 natured; and if I had to decide between you and the Baron, I
should<br>
 choose you. Monsieur Hulot is amusing, handsome, and has a
figure; but<br>
 you, you are substantial, and then--you see--you look an even
greater<br>
 scamp than he does."</p>

<p>"It is incredible how all women, even pious women, take to men
who<br>
 have that about them!" exclaimed Crevel, putting his arm
round<br>
 Lisbeth's waist, he was so jubilant.</p>

<p>"The difficulty does not lie there," said Betty. "You must see
that a<br>
 woman who is getting so many advantages will not be unfaithful
to her<br>
 patron for nothing; and it would cost you more than a hundred
odd<br>
 thousand francs, for our little friend can look forward to
seeing her<br>
 husband at the head of his office within two years' time.--It
is<br>
 poverty that is dragging the poor little angel into that
pit."</p>

<p>Crevel was striding up and down the drawing-room in a state of
frenzy.</p>

<p>"He must be uncommonly fond of the woman?" he inquired after a
pause,<br>
 while his desires, thus goaded by Lisbeth, rose to a sort of
madness.</p>

<p>"You may judge for yourself," replied Lisbeth. I don't believe
he has<br>
 had <i>that</i> of her," said she, snapping her thumbnail
against one of<br>
 her enormous white teeth, "and he has given her ten thousand
francs'<br>
 worth of presents already."</p>

<p>"What a good joke it would be!" cried Crevel, "if I got to the
winning<br>
 post first!"</p>

<p>"Good heavens! It is too bad of me to be telling you all this
tittle-<br>
 tattle," said Lisbeth, with an air of compunction.</p>

<p>"No.--I mean to put your relations to the blush. To-morrow I
shall<br>
 invest in your name such a sum in five-per-cents as will give
you six<br>
 hundred francs a year; but then you must tell me
everything--his<br>
 Dulcinea's name and residence. To you I will make a clean breast
of<br>
 it.--I never have had a real lady for a mistress, and it is the
height<br>
 of my ambition. Mahomet's houris are nothing in comparison with
what I<br>
 fancy a woman of fashion must be. In short, it is my dream, my
mania,<br>
 and to such a point, that I declare to you the Baroness Hulot to
me<br>
 will never be fifty," said he, unconsciously plagiarizing one of
the<br>
 greatest wits of the last century. "I assure you, my good
Lisbeth, I<br>
 am prepared to sacrifice a hundred, two hundred--Hush! Here are
the<br>
 young people, I see them crossing the courtyard. I shall never
have<br>
 learned anything through you, I give you my word of honor; for I
do<br>
 not want you to lose the Baron's confidence, quite the contrary.
He<br>
 must be amazingly fond of this woman--that old boy."</p>

<p>"He is crazy about her," said Lisbeth. "He could not find
forty<br>
 thousand francs to marry his daughter off, but he has got them
somehow<br>
 for his new passion."</p>

<p>"And do you think that she loves him?"</p>

<p>"At his age!" said the old maid.</p>

<p>"Oh, what an owl I am!" cried Crevel, "when I myself allowed
Heloise<br>
 to keep her artist exactly as Henri IX. allowed Gabrielle
her<br>
 Bellegrade. Alas! old age, old age!--Good-morning, Celestine.
How do,<br>
 my jewel!--And the brat? Ah! here he comes; on my honor, he
is<br>
 beginning to be like me!--Good-day, Hulot--quite well? We shall
soon<br>
 be having another wedding in the family."</p>

<p>Celestine and her husband, as a hint to their father, glanced
at the<br>
 old maid, who audaciously asked, in reply to Crevel:</p>

<p>"Indeed--whose?"</p>

<p>Crevel put on an air of reserve which was meant to convey that
he<br>
 would make up for her indiscretions.</p>

<p>"That of Hortense," he replied; "but it is not yet quite
settled. I<br>
 have just come from the Lebas', and they were talking of
Mademoiselle<br>
 Popinot as a suitable match for their son, the young councillor,
for<br>
 he would like to get the presidency of a provincial court.--Now,
come<br>
 to dinner."</p>

<p>By seven o'clock Lisbeth had returned home in an omnibus, for
she was<br>
 eager to see Wenceslas, whose dupe she had been for three weeks,
and<br>
 to whom she was carrying a basket filled with fruit by the hands
of<br>
 Crevel himself, whose attentions were doubled towards <i>his</i>
Cousin<br>
 Betty.</p>

<p>She flew up to the attic at a pace that took her breath away,
and<br>
 found the artist finishing the ornamentation of a box to be
presented<br>
 to the adored Hortense. The framework of the lid represented<br>
 hydrangeas--in French called <i>Hortensias</i>--among which
little Loves<br>
 were playing. The poor lover, to enable him to pay for the
materials<br>
 of the box, of which the panels were of malachite, had designed
two<br>
 candlesticks for Florent and Chanor, and sold them the
copyright--two<br>
 admirable pieces of work.</p>

<p>"You have been working too hard these last few days, my dear
fellow,"<br>
 said Lisbeth, wiping the perspiration from his brow, and giving
him a<br>
 kiss. "Such laborious diligence is really dangerous in the month
of<br>
 August. Seriously, you may injure your health. Look, here are
some<br>
 peaches and plums from Monsieur Crevel.--Now, do not worry
yourself so<br>
 much; I have borrowed two thousand francs, and, short of
some<br>
 disaster, we can repay them when you sell your clock. At the
same<br>
 time, the lender seems to me suspicious, for he has just sent in
this<br>
 document."</p>

<p>She laid the writ under the model sketch of the statue of
General<br>
 Montcornet.</p>

<p>"For whom are you making this pretty thing?" said she, taking
up the<br>
 model sprays of hydrangea in red wax which Wenceslas had laid
down<br>
 while eating the fruit.</p>

<p>"For a jeweler."</p>

<p>"For what jeweler?"</p>

<p>"I do not know. Stidmann asked me to make something out of
them, as he<br>
 is very busy."</p>

<p>"But these," she said in a deep voice, "are <i>Hortensias</i>.
How is it<br>
 that you have never made anything in wax for me? Is it so
difficult to<br>
 design a pin, a little box--what not, as a keepsake?" and she
shot a<br>
 fearful glance at the artist, whose eyes were happily lowered.
"And<br>
 yet you say you love me?"</p>

<p>"Can you doubt it, mademoiselle?"</p>

<p>"That is indeed an ardent <i>mademoiselle</i>!--Why, you have
been my only<br>
 thought since I found you dying--just there. When I saved you,
you<br>
 vowed you were mine, I mean to hold you to that pledge; but I
made a<br>
 vow to myself! I said to myself, 'Since the boy says he is mine,
I<br>
 mean to make him rich and happy!' Well, and I can make your
fortune."</p>

<p>"How?" said the hapless artist, at the height of joy, and too
artless<br>
 to dream of a snare.</p>

<p>"Why, thus," said she.</p>

<p>Lisbeth could not deprive herself of the savage pleasure of
gazing at<br>
 Wenceslas, who looked up at her with filial affection, the
expression<br>
 really of his love for Hortense, which deluded the old maid.
Seeing in<br>
 a man's eyes, for the first time in her life, the blazing torch
of<br>
 passion, she fancied it was for her that it was lighted.</p>

<p>"Monsieur Crevel will back us to the extent of a hundred
thousand<br>
 francs to start in business, if, as he says, you will marry me.
He has<br>
 queer ideas, has the worthy man.--Well, what do you say to it?"
she<br>
 added.</p>

<p>The artist, as pale as the dead, looked at his benefactress
with a<br>
 lustreless eye, which plainly spoke his thoughts. He stood
stupefied<br>
 and open-mouthed.</p>

<p>"I never before was so distinctly told that I am hideous,"
said she,<br>
 with a bitter laugh.</p>

<p>"Mademoiselle," said Steinbock, "my benefactress can never be
ugly in<br>
 my eyes; I have the greatest affection for you. But I am not
yet<br>
 thirty, and----"</p>

<p>"I am forty-three," said Lisbeth. "My cousin Adeline is
forty-eight,<br>
 and men are still madly in love with her; but then she is
handsome--<br>
 she is!"</p>

<p>"Fifteen years between us, mademoiselle! How could we get on
together!<br>
 For both our sakes I think we should be wise to think it over.
My<br>
 gratitude shall be fully equal to your great kindness.--And your
money<br>
 shall be repaid in a few days."</p>

<p>"My money!" cried she. "You treat me as if I were nothing but
an<br>
 unfeeling usurer."</p>

<p>"Forgive me," said Wenceslas, "but you remind me of it so
often.--<br>
 Well, it is you who have made me; do not crush me."</p>

<p>"You mean to be rid of me, I can see," said she, shaking her
head.<br>
 "Who has endowed you with this strength of ingratitude--you who
are a<br>
 man of papier-mache? Have you ceased to trust me--your good
genius?--<br>
 me, when I have spent so many nights working for you--when I
have<br>
 given you every franc I have saved in my lifetime--when for four
years<br>
 I have shared my bread with you, the bread of a hard-worked
woman, and<br>
 given you all I had, to my very courage."</p>

<p>"Mademoiselle--no more, no more!" he cried, kneeling before
her with<br>
 uplifted hands. "Say not another word! In three days I will tell
you,<br>
 you shall know all.--Let me, let me be happy," and he kissed
her<br>
 hands. "I love--and I am loved."</p>

<p>"Well, well, my child, be happy," she said, lifting him up.
And she<br>
 kissed his forehead and hair with the eagerness that a man
condemned<br>
 to death must feel as he lives through the last morning.</p>

<p>"Ah! you are of all creatures the noblest and best! You are a
match<br>
 for the woman I love," said the poor artist.</p>

<p>"I love you well enough to tremble for your future fate," said
she<br>
 gloomily. "Judas hanged himself--the ungrateful always come to a
bad<br>
 end! You are deserting me, and you will never again do any good
work.<br>
 Consider whether, without being married--for I know I am an old
maid,<br>
 and I do not want to smother the blossom of your youth, your
poetry,<br>
 as you call it, in my arms, that are like vine-stocks--but
whether,<br>
 without being married, we could not get on together? Listen; I
have<br>
 the commercial spirit; I could save you a fortune in the course
of ten<br>
 years' work, for Economy is my name!--while, with a young wife,
who<br>
 would be sheer Expenditure, you would squander everything; you
would<br>
 work only to indulge her. But happiness creates nothing but
memories.<br>
 Even I, when I am thinking of you, sit for hours with my hands
in my<br>
 lap----</p>

<p>"Come, Wenceslas, stay with me.--Look here, I understand all
about it;<br>
 you shall have your mistresses; pretty ones too, like that
little<br>
 Marneffe woman who wants to see you, and who will give you
happiness<br>
 you could never find with me. Then, when I have saved you
thirty<br>
 thousand francs a year in the funds----"</p>

<p>"Mademoiselle, you are an angel, and I shall never forget this
hour,"<br>
 said Wenceslas, wiping away his tears.</p>

<p>"That is how I like to see you, my child," said she, gazing at
him<br>
 with rapture.</p>

<p>Vanity is so strong a power in us all that Lisbeth believed in
her<br>
 triumph. She had conceded so much when offering him Madame
Marneffe.<br>
 It was the crowning emotion of her life; for the first time she
felt<br>
 the full tide of joy rising in her heart. To go through such
an<br>
 experience again she would have sold her soul to the Devil.</p>

<p>"I am engaged to be married," Steinbock replied, "and I love a
woman<br>
 with whom no other can compete or compare.--But you are, and
always<br>
 will be, to me the mother I have lost."</p>

<p>The words fell like an avalanche of snow on a burning crater.
Lisbeth<br>
 sat down. She gazed with despondent eyes on the youth before
her, on<br>
 his aristocratic beauty--the artist's brow, the splendid
hair,<br>
 everything that appealed to her suppressed feminine instincts,
and<br>
 tiny tears moistened her eyes for an instant and immediately
dried up.<br>
 She looked like one of those meagre statues which the sculptors
of the<br>
 Middle Ages carved on monuments.</p>

<p>"I cannot curse you," said she, suddenly rising. "You--you are
but a<br>
 boy. God preserve you!"</p>

<p>She went downstairs and shut herself into her own room.</p>

<p>"She is in love with me, poor creature!" said Wenceslas to
himself.<br>
 "And how fervently eloquent! She is crazy."</p>

<p>This last effort on the part of an arid and narrow nature to
keep hold<br>
 on an embodiment of beauty and poetry was, in truth, so violent
that<br>
 it can only be compared to the frenzied vehemence of a
shipwrecked<br>
 creature making the last struggle to reach shore.</p>

<p>On the next day but one, at half-past four in the morning,
when Count<br>
 Steinbock was sunk in the deepest sleep, he heard a knock at the
door<br>
 of his attic; he rose to open it, and saw two men in shabby
clothing,<br>
 and a third, whose dress proclaimed him a bailiff down on his
luck.</p>

<p>"You are Monsieur Wenceslas, Count Steinbock?" said this
man.</p>

<p>"Yes, monsieur."</p>

<p>"My name is Grasset, sir, successor to Louchard, sheriff's<br>
 officer----"</p>

<p>"What then?"</p>

<p>"You are under arrest, sir. You must come with us to
prison--to<br>
 Clichy.--Please to get dressed.--We have done the civil, as you
see; I<br>
 have brought no police, and there is a hackney cab below."</p>

<p>"You are safely nabbed, you see," said one of the bailiffs;
"and we<br>
 look to you to be liberal."</p>

<p>Steinbock dressed and went downstairs, a man holding each arm;
when he<br>
 was in the cab, the driver started without orders, as knowing
where he<br>
 was to go, and within half an hour the unhappy foreigner found
himself<br>
 safely under bolt and bar without even a remonstrance, so
utterly<br>
 amazed was he.</p>

<p>At ten o'clock he was sent for to the prison-office, where he
found<br>
 Lisbeth, who, in tears, gave him some money to feed himself
adequately<br>
 and to pay for a room large enough to work in.</p>

<p>"My dear boy," said she, "never say a word of your arrest to
anybody,<br>
 do not write to a living soul; it would ruin you for life; we
must<br>
 hide this blot on your character. I will soon have you out. I
will<br>
 collect the money--be quite easy. Write down what you want for
your<br>
 work. You shall soon be free, or I will die for it."</p>

<p>"Oh, I shall owe you my life a second time!" cried he, "for I
should<br>
 lose more than my life if I were thought a bad fellow."</p>

<p>Lisbeth went off in great glee; she hoped, by keeping her
artist under<br>
 lock and key, to put a stop to his marriage by announcing that
he was<br>
 a married man, pardoned by the efforts of his wife, and gone off
to<br>
 Russia.</p>

<p>To carry out this plan, at about three o'clock she went to
the<br>
 Baroness, though it was not the day when she was due to dine
with her;<br>
 but she wished to enjoy the anguish which Hortense must endure
at the<br>
 hour when Wenceslas was in the habit of making his
appearance.</p>

<p>"Have you come to dinner?" asked the Baroness, concealing
her<br>
 disappointment.</p>

<p>"Well, yes."</p>

<p>"That's well," replied Hortense. "I will go and tell them to
be<br>
 punctual, for you do not like to be kept waiting."</p>

<p>Hortense nodded reassuringly to her mother, for she intended
to tell<br>
 the man-servant to send away Monsieur Steinbock if he should
call; the<br>
 man, however, happened to be out, so Hortense was obliged to
give her<br>
 orders to the maid, and the girl went upstairs to fetch her
needlework<br>
 and sit in the ante-room.</p>

<p>"And about my lover?" said Cousin Betty to Hortense, when the
girl<br>
 came back. "You never ask about him now?"</p>

<p>"To be sure, what is he doing?" said Hortense. "He has become
famous.<br>
 You ought to be very happy," she added in an undertone to
Lisbeth.<br>
 "Everybody is talking of Monsieur Wenceslas Steinbock."</p>

<p>"A great deal too much," replied she in her clear tones.
"Monsieur is<br>
 departing.--If it were only a matter of charming him so far as
to defy<br>
 the attractions of Paris, I know my power; but they say that in
order<br>
 to secure the services of such an artist, the Emperor Nichols
has<br>
 pardoned him----"</p>

<p>"Nonsense!" said the Baroness.</p>

<p>"When did you hear that?" asked Hortense, who felt as if her
heart had<br>
 the cramp.</p>

<p>"Well," said the villainous Lisbeth, "a person to whom he is
bound by<br>
 the most sacred ties--his wife--wrote yesterday to tell him so.
He<br>
 wants to be off. Oh, he will be a great fool to give up France
to go<br>
 to Russia!--"</p>

<p>Hortense looked at her mother, but her head sank on one side;
the<br>
 Baroness was only just in time to support her daughter, who
dropped<br>
 fainting, and as white as her lace kerchief.</p>

<p>"Lisbeth! you have killed my child!" cried the Baroness. "You
were<br>
 born to be our curse!"</p>

<p>"Bless me! what fault of mine is this, Adeline?" replied
Lisbeth, as<br>
 she rose with a menacing aspect, of which the Baroness, in her
alarm,<br>
 took no notice.</p>

<p>"I was wrong," said Adeline, supporting the girl. "Ring."</p>

<p>At this instant the door opened, the women both looked round,
and saw<br>
 Wenceslas Steinbock, who had been admitted by the cook in the
maid's<br>
 absence.</p>

<p>"Hortense!" cried the artist, with one spring to the group of
women.<br>
 And he kissed his betrothed before her mother's eyes, on the
forehead,<br>
 and so reverently, that the Baroness could not be angry. It was
a<br>
 better restorative than any smelling salts. Hortense opened her
eyes,<br>
 saw Wenceslas, and her color came back. In a few minutes she had
quite<br>
 recovered.</p>

<p>"So this was your secret?" said Lisbeth, smiling at Wenceslas,
and<br>
 affecting to guess the facts from her two cousins'
confusion.</p>

<p>"But how did you steal away my lover?" said she, leading
Hortense into<br>
 the garden.</p>

<p>Hortense artlessly told the romance of her love. Her father
and<br>
 mother, she said, being convinced that Lisbeth would never
marry, had<br>
 authorized the Count's visits. Only Hortense, like a full-blown
Agnes,<br>
 attributed to chance her purchase of the group and the
introduction of<br>
 the artist, who, by her account, had insisted on knowing the
name of<br>
 his first purchaser.</p>

<p>Presently Steinbock came out to join the cousins, and thanked
the old<br>
 maid effusively for his prompt release. Lisbeth replied
Jesuitically<br>
 that the creditor having given very vague promises, she had not
hoped<br>
 to be able to get him out before the morrow, and that the person
who<br>
 had lent her the money, ashamed, perhaps, of such mean conduct,
had<br>
 been beforehand with her. The old maid appeared to be
perfectly<br>
 content, and congratulated Wenceslas on his happiness.</p>

<p>"You bad boy!" said she, before Hortense and her mother, "if
you had<br>
 only told me the evening before last that you loved my
cousin<br>
 Hortense, and that she loved you, you would have spared me many
tears.<br>
 I thought that you were deserting your old friend, your
governess;<br>
 while, on the contrary, you are to become my cousin; henceforth,
you<br>
 will be connected with me, remotely, it is true, but by ties
that<br>
 amply justify the feelings I have for you." And she kissed
Wenceslas<br>
 on the forehead.</p>

<p>Hortense threw herself into Lisbeth's arms and melted into
tears.</p>

<p>"I owe my happiness to you," said she, "and I will never
forget it."</p>

<p>"Cousin Betty," said the Baroness, embracing Lisbeth in her
excitement<br>
 at seeing matters so happily settled, "the Baron and I owe you a
debt<br>
 of gratitude, and we will pay it. Come and talk things over with
me,"<br>
 she added, leading her away.</p>

<p>So Lisbeth, to all appearances, was playing the part of a good
angel<br>
 to the whole family; she was adored by Crevel and Hulot, by
Adeline<br>
 and Hortense.</p>

<p>"We wish you to give up working," said the Baroness. "If you
earn<br>
 forty sous a day, Sundays excepted, that makes six hundred
francs a<br>
 year. Well, then, how much have you saved?"</p>

<p>"Four thousand five hundred francs."</p>

<p>"Poor Betty!" said her cousin.</p>

<p>She raised her eyes to heaven, so deeply was she moved at the
thought<br>
 of all the labor and privation such a sum must represent
accumulated<br>
 during thirty years.</p>

<p>Lisbeth, misunderstanding the meaning of the exclamation, took
it as<br>
 the ironical pity of the successful woman, and her hatred
was<br>
 strengthened by a large infusion of venom at the very moment
when her<br>
 cousin had cast off her last shred of distrust of the tyrant of
her<br>
 childhood.</p>

<p>"We will add ten thousand five hundred francs to that sum,"
said<br>
 Adeline, "and put it in trust so that you shall draw the
interest for<br>
 life with reversion to Hortense. Thus, you will have six
hundred<br>
 francs a year."</p>

<p>Lisbeth feigned the utmost satisfaction. When she went in,
her<br>
 handkerchief to her eyes, wiping away tears of joy, Hortense
told her<br>
 of all the favors being showered on Wenceslas, beloved of the
family.</p>

<p>So when the Baron came home, he found his family all present;
for the<br>
 Baroness had formally accepted Wenceslas by the title of Son,
and the<br>
 wedding was fixed, if her husband should approve, for a day
a<br>
 fortnight hence. The moment he came into the drawing-room, Hulot
was<br>
 rushed at by his wife and daughter, who ran to meet him, Adeline
to<br>
 speak to him privately, and Hortense to kiss him.</p>

<p>"You have gone too far in pledging me to this, madame," said
the Baron<br>
 sternly. "You are not married yet," he added with a look at
Steinbock,<br>
 who turned pale.</p>

<p>"He has heard of my imprisonment," said the luckless artist
to<br>
 himself.</p>

<p>"Come, children," said he, leading his daughter and the young
man into<br>
 the garden; they all sat down on the moss-eaten seat in the
summer-<br>
 house.</p>

<p>"Monsieur le Comte, do you love my daughter as well as I loved
her<br>
 mother?" he asked.</p>

<p>"More, monsieur," said the sculptor.</p>

<p>"Her mother was a peasant's daughter, and had not a farthing
of her<br>
 own."</p>

<p>"Only give me Mademoiselle Hortense just as she is, without
a<br>
 trousseau even----"</p>

<p>"So I should think!" said the Baron, smiling. "Hortense is
the<br>
 daughter of the Baron Hulot d'Ervy, Councillor of State, high up
in<br>
 the War Office, Grand Commander of the Legion of Honor, and
the<br>
 brother to Count Hulot, whose glory is immortal, and who will
ere long<br>
 be Marshal of France! And--she has a marriage portion.</p>

<p>"It is true," said the impassioned artist. "I must seem
very<br>
 ambitious. But if my dear Hortense were a laborer's daughter, I
would<br>
 marry her----"</p>

<p>"That is just what I wanted to know," replied the Baron. "Run
away,<br>
 Hortense, and leave me to talk business with Monsieur le
Comte.--He<br>
 really loves you, you see!"</p>

<p>"Oh, papa, I was sure you were only in jest," said the happy
girl.</p>

<p>"My dear Steinbock," said the Baron, with elaborate grace of
diction<br>
 and the most perfect manners, as soon as he and the artist were
alone,<br>
 "I promised my son a fortune of two hundred thousand francs, of
which<br>
 the poor boy has never had a sou; and he never will get any of
it. My<br>
 daughter's fortune will also be two hundred thousand francs, for
which<br>
 you will give a receipt----"</p>

<p>"Yes, Monsieur le Baron."</p>

<p>"You go too fast," said Hulot. "Have the goodness to hear me
out. I<br>
 cannot expect from a son-in-law such devotion as I look for from
my<br>
 son. My son knew exactly all I could and would do for his
future<br>
 promotion: he will be a Minister, and will easily make good his
two<br>
 hundred thousand francs. But with you, young man, matters
are<br>
 different. I shall give you a bond for sixty thousand francs in
State<br>
 funds at five per cent, in your wife's name. This income will
be<br>
 diminished by a small charge in the form of an annuity to
Lisbeth; but<br>
 she will not live long; she is consumptive, I know. Tell no one;
it is<br>
 a secret; let the poor soul die in peace.--My daughter will have
a<br>
 trousseau worth twenty thousand francs; her mother will give her
six<br>
 thousand francs worth of diamonds.</p>

<p><br>
 "Monsieur, you overpower me!" said Steinbock, quite
bewildered.</p>

<p>"As to the remaining hundred and twenty thousand
francs----"</p>

<p>"Say no more, monsieur," said Wenceslas. "I ask only for my
beloved<br>
 Hortense----"</p>

<p>"Will you listen to me, effervescent youth!--As to the
remaining<br>
 hundred and twenty thousand francs, I have not got them; but you
will<br>
 have them--"</p>

<p>"Monsieur?"</p>

<p>"You will get them from the Government, in payment for
commissions<br>
 which I will secure for you, I pledge you my word of honor. You
are to<br>
 have a studio, you see, at the Government depot. Exhibit a few
fine<br>
 statues, and I will get you received at the Institute. The
highest<br>
 personages have a regard for my brother and for me, and I hope
to<br>
 succeed in securing for you a commission for sculpture at
Versailles<br>
 up to a quarter of the whole sum. You will have orders from the
City<br>
 of Paris and from the Chamber of Peers; in short, my dear
fellow, you<br>
 will have so many that you will be obliged to get assistants. In
that<br>
 way I shall pay off my debt to you. You must say whether this
way of<br>
 giving a portion will suit you; whether you are equal to
it."</p>

<p>"I am equal to making a fortune for my wife single-handed if
all else<br>
 failed!" cried the artist-nobleman.</p>

<p>"That is what I admire!" cried the Baron. "High-minded youth
that<br>
 fears nothing. Come," he added, clasping hands with the young
sculptor<br>
 to conclude the bargain, "you have my consent. We will sign
the<br>
 contract on Sunday next, and the wedding shall be on the
following<br>
 Saturday, my wife's fete-day."</p>

<p>"It is alright," said the Baroness to her daughter, who stood
glued to<br>
 the window. "Your suitor and your father are embracing each
other."</p>

<p>On going home in the evening, Wenceslas found the solution of
the<br>
 mystery of his release. The porter handed him a thick sealed
packet,<br>
 containing the schedule of his debts, with a signed receipt
affixed at<br>
 the bottom of the writ, and accompanied by this letter:--</p>

<p>"MY DEAR WENCESLAS,--I went to fetch you at ten o'clock
this<br>
 morning to introduce you to a Royal Highness who wishes to
see<br>
 you. There I learned that the duns had had you conveyed to a<br>
 certain little domain--chief town, <i>Clichy Castle.</i></p>

<p>"So off I went to Leon de Lora, and told him, for a joke, that
you<br>
 could not leave your country quarters for lack of four
thousand<br>
 francs, and that you would spoil your future prospects if you
did<br>
 not make your bow to your royal patron. Happily, Bridau was
there<br>
 --a man of genius, who has known what it is to be poor, and
has<br>
 heard your story. My boy, between them they have found the
money,<br>
 and I went off to pay the Turk who committed treason against<br>
 genius by putting you in quod. As I had to be at the Tuileries
at<br>
 noon, I could not wait to see you sniffing the outer air. I
know<br>
 you to be a gentleman, and I answered for you to my two
friends--<br>
 but look them up to-morrow.</p>

<p>"Leon and Bridau do not want your cash; they will ask you to
do<br>
 them each a group--and they are right. At least, so thinks the
man<br>
 who wishes he could sign himself your rival, but is only
your<br>
 faithful ally,</p>

<p>"STIDMANN.</p>

<p>"P. S.--I told the Prince you were away, and would not return
till<br>
 to-morrow, so he said, 'Very good--to-morrow.' "</p>

<p><br>
 Count Wenceslas went to bed in sheets of purple, without a
rose-leaf<br>
 to wrinkle them, that Favor can make for us--Favor, the
halting<br>
 divinity who moves more slowly for men of genius than either
Justice<br>
 or Fortune, because Jove has not chosen to bandage her eyes.
Hence,<br>
 lightly deceived by the display of impostors, and attracted by
their<br>
 frippery and trumpets, she spends the time in seeing them and
the<br>
 money in paying them which she ought to devote to seeking out
men of<br>
 merit in the nooks where they hide.</p>

<p>It will now be necessary to explain how Monsieur le Baron
Hulot had<br>
 contrived to count up his expenditure on Hortense's wedding
portion,<br>
 and at the same time to defray the frightful cost of the
charming<br>
 rooms where Madame Marneffe was to make her home. His financial
scheme<br>
 bore that stamp of talent which leads prodigals and men in love
into<br>
 the quagmires where so many disasters await them. Nothing
can<br>
 demonstrate more completely the strange capacity communicated by
vice,<br>
 to which we owe the strokes of skill which ambitious or
voluptuous men<br>
 can occasionally achieve--or, in short, any of the Devil's
pupils.</p>

<p>On the day before, old Johann Fischer, unable to pay thirty
thousand<br>
 francs drawn for on him by his nephew, had found himself under
the<br>
 necessity of stopping payment unless the Baron could remit the
sum.</p>

<p>This ancient worthy, with the white hairs of seventy years,
had such<br>
 blind confidence in Hulot--who, to the old Bonapartist, was
an<br>
 emanation from the Napoleonic sun--that he was calmly pacing
his<br>
 anteroom with the bank clerk, in the little ground-floor
apartment<br>
 that he rented for eight hundred francs a year as the
headquarters of<br>
 his extensive dealings in corn and forage.</p>

<p>"Marguerite is gone to fetch the money from close by," said
he.</p>

<p>The official, in his gray uniform braided with silver, was
so<br>
 convinced of the old Alsatian's honesty, that he was prepared to
leave<br>
 the thirty thousand francs' worth of bills in his hands; but the
old<br>
 man would not let him go, observing that the clock had not yet
struck<br>
 eight. A cab drew up, the old man rushed into the street, and
held out<br>
 his hand to the Baron with sublime confidence--Hulot handed him
out<br>
 thirty thousand-franc notes.</p>

<p>"Go on three doors further, and I will tell you why," said
Fischer.</p>

<p>"Here, young man," he said, returning to count out the money
to the<br>
 bank emissary, whom he then saw to the door.</p>

<p>When the clerk was out of sight, Fischer called back the
cab<br>
 containing his august nephew, Napoleon's right hand, and said,
as he<br>
 led him into the house:</p>

<p>"You do not want them to know at the Bank of France that you
paid me<br>
 the thirty thousand francs, after endorsing the bills?--It was
bad<br>
 enough to see them signed by such a man as you!--"</p>

<p>"Come to the bottom of your little garden, Father Fischer,"
said the<br>
 important man. "You are hearty?" he went on, sitting down under
a vine<br>
 arbor and scanning the old man from head to foot, as a dealer in
human<br>
 flesh scans a substitute for the conscription.</p>

<p>"Ay, hearty enough for a tontine," said the lean little old
man; his<br>
 sinews were wiry, and his eye bright.</p>

<p>"Does heat disagree with you?"</p>

<p>"Quite the contrary."</p>

<p>"What do you say to Africa?"</p>

<p>"A very nice country!--The French went there with the little
Corporal"<br>
 (Napoleon).</p>

<p>"To get us all out of the present scrape, you must go to
Algiers,"<br>
 said the Baron.</p>

<p>"And how about my business?"</p>

<p>"An official in the War Office, who has to retire, and has not
enough<br>
 to live on with his pension, will buy your business."</p>

<p>"And what am I to do in Algiers?"</p>

<p>"Supply the Commissariat with victuals, corn, and forage; I
have your<br>
 commission ready filled in and signed. You can collect supplies
in the<br>
 country at seventy per cent below the prices at which you can
credit<br>
 us."</p>

<p>"How shall we get them?"</p>

<p>"Oh, by raids, by taxes in kind, and the Khaliphat.--The
country is<br>
 little known, though we settled there eight years ago;
Algeria<br>
 produces vast quantities of corn and forage. When this produce
belongs<br>
 to Arabs, we take it from them under various pretences; when
it<br>
 belongs to us, the Arabs try to get it back again. There is a
great<br>
 deal of fighting over the corn, and no one ever knows exactly
how much<br>
 each party has stolen from the other. There is not time in the
open<br>
 field to measure the corn as we do in the Paris market, or the
hay as<br>
 it is sold in the Rue d'Enfer. The Arab chiefs, like our
Spahis,<br>
 prefer hard cash, and sell the plunder at a very low price.
The<br>
 Commissariat needs a fixed quantity and must have it. It winks
at<br>
 exorbitant prices calculated on the difficulty of procuring
food, and<br>
 the dangers to which every form of transport is exposed. That
is<br>
 Algiers from the army contractor's point of view.</p>

<p>"It is a muddle tempered by the ink-bottle, like every
incipient<br>
 government. We shall not see our way through it for another ten
years<br>
 --we who have to do the governing; but private enterprise has
sharp<br>
 eyes.--So I am sending you there to make a fortune; I give you
the<br>
 job, as Napoleon put an impoverished Marshal at the head of a
kingdom<br>
 where smuggling might be secretly encouraged.</p>

<p>"I am ruined, my dear Fischer; I must have a hundred thousand
francs<br>
 within a year."</p>

<p>"I see no harm in getting it out of the Bedouins," said the
Alsatian<br>
 calmly. "It was always done under the Empire----"</p>

<p>"The man who wants to buy your business will be here this
morning, and<br>
 pay you ten thousand francs down," the Baron went on. "That will
be<br>
 enough, I suppose, to take you to Africa?"</p>

<p>The old man nodded assent.</p>

<p>"As to capital out there, be quite easy. I will draw the
remainder of<br>
 the money due if I find it necessary."</p>

<p>"All I have is yours--my very blood," said old Fischer.</p>

<p>"Oh, do not be uneasy," said Hulot, fancying that his uncle
saw more<br>
 clearly than was the fact. "As to our excise dealings, your
character<br>
 will not be impugned. Everything depends on the authority at
your<br>
 back; now I myself appointed the authorities out there; I am
sure of<br>
 them. This, Uncle Fischer, is a dead secret between us. I know
you<br>
 well, and I have spoken out without concealment or
circumlocution."</p>

<p>"It shall be done," said the old man. "And it will go
on----?"</p>

<p>"For two years, You will have made a hundred thousand francs
of your<br>
 own to live happy on in the Vosges."</p>

<p>"I will do as you wish; my honor is yours," said the little
old man<br>
 quietly.</p>

<p>"That is the sort of man I like.--However, you must not go
till you<br>
 have seen your grand-niece happily married. She is to be a
Countess."</p>

<p>But even taxes and raids and the money paid by the War Office
clerk<br>
 for Fischer's business could not forthwith provide sixty
thousand<br>
 francs to give Hortense, to say nothing of her trousseau, which
was to<br>
 cost about five thousand, and the forty thousand spent--or to be
spent<br>
 --on Madame Marneffe.</p>

<p>Where, then had the Baron found the thirty thousand francs he
had just<br>
 produced? This was the history.</p>

<p>A few days previously Hulot had insured his life for the sum
of a<br>
 hundred and fifty thousand francs, for three years, in two
separate<br>
 companies. Armed with the policies, of which he paid the
premium, he<br>
 had spoken as follows to the Baron de Nucingen, a peer of the
Chamber,<br>
 in whose carriage he found himself after a sitting, driving
home, in<br>
 fact, to dine with him:--</p>

<p>"Baron, I want seventy thousand francs, and I apply to you.
You must<br>
 find some one to lend his name, to whom I will make over the
right to<br>
 draw my pay for three years; it amounts to twenty-five thousand
francs<br>
 a year--that is, seventy-five thousand francs.--You will say,
'But you<br>
 may die' "--the banker signified his assent--"Here, then, is a
policy<br>
 of insurance for a hundred and fifty thousand francs, which I
will<br>
 deposit with you till you have drawn up the eighty thousand
francs,"<br>
 said Hulot, producing the document form his pocket.</p>

<p>"But if you should lose your place?" said the millionaire
Baron,<br>
 laughing.</p>

<p>The other Baron--not a millionaire--looked grave.</p>

<p>"Be quite easy; I only raised the question to show you that I
was not<br>
 devoid of merit in handing you the sum. Are you so short of
cash? for<br>
 the Bank will take your signature."</p>

<p>"My daughter is to be married," said Baron Hulot, "and I have
no<br>
 fortune--like every one else who remains in office in these
thankless<br>
 times, when five hundred ordinary men seated on benches will
never<br>
 reward the men who devote themselves to the service as
handsomely as<br>
 the Emperor did."</p>

<p>"Well, well; but you had Josepha on your hands!" replied
Nucingen,<br>
 "and that accounts for everything. Between ourselves, the
Duc<br>
 d'Herouville has done you a very good turn by removing that
leech from<br>
 sucking your purse dry. 'I have known what that is, and can pity
your<br>
 case,' " he quoted. "Take a friend's advice: Shut up shop, or
you will<br>
 be done for."</p>

<p>This dirty business was carried out in the name of one
Vauvinet, a<br>
 small money-lender; one of those jobbers who stand forward to
screen<br>
 great banking houses, like the little fish that is said to
attend the<br>
 shark. This stock-jobber's apprentice was so anxious to gain
the<br>
 patronage of Monsieur le Baron Hulot, that he promised the great
man<br>
 to negotiate bills of exchange for thirty thousand francs at
eighty<br>
 days, and pledged himself to renew them four times, and never
pass<br>
 them out of his hands.</p>

<p>Fischer's successor was to pay forty thousand francs for the
house and<br>
 the business, with the promise that he should supply forage to
a<br>
 department close to Paris.</p>

<p>This was the desperate maze of affairs into which a man who
had<br>
 hitherto been absolutely honest was led by his passions--one of
the<br>
 best administrative officials under Napoleon--peculation to pay
the<br>
 money-lenders, and borrowing of the money-lenders to gratify
his<br>
 passions and provide for his daughter. All the efforts of
this<br>
 elaborate prodigality were directed at making a display before
Madame<br>
 Marneffe, and to playing Jupiter to this middle-class Danae. A
man<br>
 could not expend more activity, intelligence, and presence of
mind in<br>
 the honest acquisition of a fortune than the Baron displayed
in<br>
 shoving his head into a wasp's nest: He did all the business of
his<br>
 department, he hurried on the upholsterers, he talked to the
workmen,<br>
 he kept a sharp lookout on the smallest details of the house in
the<br>
 Rue Vanneau. Wholly devoted to Madame Marneffe, he
nevertheless<br>
 attended the sittings of the Chambers; he was everywhere at
once, and<br>
 neither his family nor anybody else discovered where his
thoughts<br>
 were.</p>

<p>Adeline, quite amazed to hear that her uncle was rescued, and
to see a<br>
 handsome sum figure in the marriage-contract, was not altogether
easy,<br>
 in spite of her joy at seeing her daughter married under
such<br>
 creditable circumstances. But, on the day before the wedding,
fixed by<br>
 the Baron to coincide with Madame Marneffe's removal to her
new<br>
 apartment, Hector allayed his wife's astonishment by this
ministerial<br>
 communication:--</p>

<p>"Now, Adeline, our girl is married; all our anxieties on the
subject<br>
 are at an end. The time is come for us to retire from the world:
I<br>
 shall not remain in office more than three years longer--only
the time<br>
 necessary to secure my pension. Why, henceforth, should we be at
any<br>
 unnecessary expense? Our apartment costs us six thousand francs
a year<br>
 in rent, we have four servants, we eat thirty thousand francs'
worth<br>
 of food in a year. If you want me to pay off my bills--for I
have<br>
 pledged my salary for the sums I needed to give Hortense her
little<br>
 money, and pay off your uncle----"</p>

<p>"You did very right!" said she, interrupting her husband, and
kissing<br>
 his hands.</p>

<p>This explanation relieved Adeline of all her fears.</p>

<p>"I shall have to ask some little sacrifices of you," he went
on,<br>
 disengaging his hands and kissing his wife's brow. "I have found
in<br>
 the Rue Plumet a very good flat on the first floor,
handsome,<br>
 splendidly paneled, at only fifteen hundred francs a year, where
you<br>
 would only need one woman to wait on you, and I could be quite
content<br>
 with a boy."</p>

<p>"Yes, my dear."</p>

<p>"If we keep house in a quiet way, keeping up a proper
appearance of<br>
 course, we should not spend more than six thousand francs a
year,<br>
 excepting my private account, which I will provide for."</p>

<p>The generous-hearted woman threw her arms round her husband's
neck in<br>
 her joy.</p>

<p>"How happy I shall be, beginning again to show you how truly I
love<br>
 you!" she exclaimed. "And what a capital manager you are!"</p>

<p>"We will have the children to dine with us once a week. I, as
you<br>
 know, rarely dine at home. You can very well dine twice a week
with<br>
 Victorin and twice a week with Hortense. And, as I believe, I
may<br>
 succeed in making matters up completely between Crevel and us;
we can<br>
 dine once a week with him. These five dinners and our own at
home will<br>
 fill up the week all but one day, supposing that we may
occasionally<br>
 be invited to dine elsewhere."</p>

<p>"I shall save a great deal for you," said Adeline.</p>

<p>"Oh!" he cried, "you are the pearl of women!"</p>

<p>"My kind, divine Hector, I shall bless you with my latest
breath,"<br>
 said she, "for you have done well for my dear Hortense."</p>

<p>This was the beginning of the end of the beautiful Madame
Hulot's<br>
 home; and, it may be added, of her being totally neglected, as
Hulot<br>
 had solemnly promised Madame Marneffe.</p>

<p>Crevel, the important and burly, being invited as a matter of
course<br>
 to the party given for the signing of the marriage-contract,
behaved<br>
 as though the scene with which this drama opened had never
taken<br>
 place, as though he had no grievance against the Baron.
Celestin<br>
 Crevel was quite amiable; he was perhaps rather too much the<br>
 ex-perfumer, but as a Major he was beginning to acquire
majestic<br>
 dignity. He talked of dancing at the wedding.</p>

<p>"Fair lady," said he politely to the Baroness, "people like us
know<br>
 how to forget. Do not banish me from your home; honor me, pray,
by<br>
 gracing my house with your presence now and then to meet
your<br>
 children. Be quite easy; I will never say anything of what lies
buried<br>
 at the bottom of my heart. I behaved, indeed, like an idiot, for
I<br>
 should lose too much by cutting myself off from seeing you."</p>

<p>"Monsieur, an honest woman has no ears for such speeches as
those you<br>
 refer to. If you keep your word, you need not doubt that it will
give<br>
 me pleasure to see the end of a coolness which must always be
painful<br>
 in a family."</p>

<p>"Well, you sulky old fellow," said Hulot, dragging Crevel out
into the<br>
 garden, "you avoid me everywhere, even in my own house. Are
two<br>
 admirers of the fair sex to quarrel for ever over a petticoat?
Come;<br>
 this is really too plebeian!"</p>

<p>"I, monsieur, am not such a fine man as you are, and my
small<br>
 attractions hinder me from repairing my losses so easily as
you<br>
 can----"</p>

<p>"Sarcastic!" said the Baron.</p>

<p>"Irony is allowable from the vanquished to the conquerer."</p>

<p>The conversation, begun in this strain, ended in a
complete<br>
 reconciliation; still Crevel maintained his right to take his
revenge.</p>

<p>Madame Marneffe particularly wished to be invited to
Mademoiselle<br>
 Hulot's wedding. To enable him to receive his future mistress in
his<br>
 drawing-room, the great official was obliged to invite all the
clerks<br>
 of his division down to the deputy head-clerks inclusive. Thus a
grand<br>
 ball was a necessity. The Baroness, as a prudent housewife,
calculated<br>
 that an evening party would cost less than a dinner, and allow
of a<br>
 larger number of invitations; so Hortense's wedding was much
talked<br>
 about.</p>

<p><br>
 Marshal Prince Wissembourg and the Baron de Nucingen signed in
behalf<br>
 of the bride, the Comtes de Rastignac and Popinot in behalf
of<br>
 Steinbock. Then, as the highest nobility among the Polish
emigrants<br>
 had been civil to Count Steinbock since he had become famous,
the<br>
 artist thought himself bound to invite them. The State Council,
and<br>
 the War Office to which the Baron belonged, and the army,
anxious to<br>
 do honor to the Comte de Forzheim, were all represented by
their<br>
 magnates. There were nearly two hundred indispensable
invitations. How<br>
 natural, then, that little Madame Marneffe was bent on figuring
in all<br>
 her glory amid such an assembly. The Baroness had, a month
since, sold<br>
 her diamonds to set up her daughter's house, while keeping the
finest<br>
 for the trousseau. The sale realized fifteen thousand francs, of
which<br>
 five thousand were sunk in Hortense's clothes. And what was
ten<br>
 thousand francs for the furniture of the young folks'
apartment,<br>
 considering the demands of modern luxury? However, young
Monsieur and<br>
 Madame Hulot, old Crevel, and the Comte de Forzheim made very
handsome<br>
 presents, for the old soldier had set aside a sum for the
purchase of<br>
 plate. Thanks to these contributions, even an exacting Parisian
would<br>
 have been pleased with the rooms the young couple had taken in
the Rue<br>
 Saint-Dominique, near the Invalides. Everything seemed in
harmony with<br>
 their love, pure, honest, and sincere.</p>

<p>At last the great day dawned--for it was to be a great day not
only<br>
 for Wenceslas and Hortense, but for old Hulot too. Madame
Marneffe was<br>
 to give a house-warming in her new apartment the day after
becoming<br>
 Hulot's mistress <i>en titre</i>, and after the marriage of the
lovers.</p>

<p>Who but has once in his life been a guest at a wedding-ball?
Every<br>
 reader can refer to his reminiscences, and will probably smile
as he<br>
 calls up the images of all that company in their Sunday-best
faces as<br>
 well as their finest frippery.</p>

<p>If any social event can prove the influence of environment, is
it not<br>
 this? In fact, the Sunday-best mood of some reacts so
effectually on<br>
 the rest that the men who are most accustomed to wearing full
dress<br>
 look just like those to whom the party is a high festival,
unique in<br>
 their life. And think too of the serious old men to whom such
things<br>
 are so completely a matter of indifference, that they are
wearing<br>
 their everyday black coats; the long-married men, whose faces
betray<br>
 their sad experience of the life the young pair are but just
entering<br>
 on; and the lighter elements, present as carbonic-acid gas is
in<br>
 champagne; and the envious girls, the women absorbed in
wondering if<br>
 their dress is a success, the poor relations whose parsimonious
"get-<br>
 up" contrasts with that of the officials in uniform; and the
greedy<br>
 ones, thinking only of the supper; and the gamblers, thinking
only of<br>
 cards.</p>

<p>There are some of every sort, rich and poor, envious and
envied,<br>
 philosophers and dreamers, all grouped like the plants in a
flower-bed<br>
 round the rare, choice blossom, the bride. A wedding-ball is
an<br>
 epitome of the world.</p>

<p>At the liveliest moment of the evening Crevel led the Baron
aside, and<br>
 said in a whisper, with the most natural manner possible:</p>

<p>"By Jove! that's a pretty woman--the little lady in pink who
has<br>
 opened a racking fire on you from her eyes."</p>

<p>"Which?"</p>

<p>"The wife of that clerk you are promoting, heaven knows
how!--Madame<br>
 Marneffe."</p>

<p>"What do you know about it?"</p>

<p>"Listen, Hulot; I will try to forgive you the ill you have
done me if<br>
 only you will introduce me to her--I will take you to
Heloise.<br>
 Everybody is asking who is that charming creature. Are you sure
that<br>
 it will strike no one how and why her husband's appointment got
itself<br>
 signed?--You happy rascal, she is worth a whole office.--I would
serve<br>
 in her office only too gladly.--Come, cinna, let us be
friends."</p>

<p>"Better friends than ever," said the Baron to the perfumer,
"and I<br>
 promise you I will be a good fellow. Within a month you shall
dine<br>
 with that little angel.--For it is an angel this time, old boy.
And I<br>
 advise you, like me, to have done with the devils."</p>

<p>Cousin Betty, who had moved to the Rue Vanneau, into a nice
little<br>
 apartment on the third floor, left the ball at ten o'clock, but
came<br>
 back to see with her own eyes the two bonds bearing twelve
hundred<br>
 francs interest; one of them was the property of the
Countess<br>
 Steinbock, the other was in the name of Madame Hulot.</p>

<p>It is thus intelligible that Monsieur Crevel should have
spoken to<br>
 Hulot about Madame Marneffe, as knowing what was a secret to the
rest<br>
 of the world; for, as Monsieur Marneffe was away, no one but
Lisbeth<br>
 Fischer, besides the Baron and Valerie, was initiated into
the<br>
 mystery.</p>

<p>The Baron had made a blunder in giving Madame Marneffe a dress
far too<br>
 magnificent for the wife of a subordinate official; other women
were<br>
 jealous alike of her beauty and of her gown. There was much
whispering<br>
 behind fans, for the poverty of the Marneffes was known to every
one<br>
 in the office; the husband had been petitioning for help at the
very<br>
 moment when the Baron had been so smitten with madame. Also,
Hector<br>
 could not conceal his exultation at seeing Valerie's success;
and she,<br>
 severely proper, very lady-like, and greatly envied, was the
object of<br>
 that strict examination which women so greatly fear when they
appear<br>
 for the first time in a new circle of society.</p>

<p>After seeing his wife into a carriage with his daughter and
his son-<br>
 in-law, Hulot managed to escape unperceived, leaving his son
and<br>
 Celestine to do the honors of the house. He got into Madame
Marneffe's<br>
 carriage to see her home, but he found her silent and pensive,
almost<br>
 melancholy.</p>

<p>"My happiness makes you very sad, Valerie," said he, putting
his arm<br>
 round her and drawing her to him.</p>

<p>"Can you wonder, my dear," said she, "that a hapless woman
should be a<br>
 little depressed at the thought of her first fall from virtue,
even<br>
 when her husband's atrocities have set her free? Do you suppose
that I<br>
 have no soul, no beliefs, no religion? Your glee this evening
has been<br>
 really too barefaced; you have paraded me odiously. Really,
a<br>
 schoolboy would have been less of a coxcomb. And the ladies
have<br>
 dissected me with their side-glances and their satirical
remarks.<br>
 Every woman has some care for her reputation, and you have
wrecked<br>
 mine.</p>

<p>"Oh, I am yours and no mistake! And I have not an excuse left
but that<br>
 of being faithful to you.--Monster that you are!" she added,
laughing,<br>
 and allowing him to kiss her, "you knew very well what you were
doing!<br>
 Madame Coquet, our chief clerk's wife, came to sit down by me,
and<br>
 admired my lace. 'English point!' said she. 'Was it very
expensive,<br>
 madame?'--'I do not know. This lace was my mother's. I am not
rich<br>
 enough to buy the like,' said I."</p>

<p>Madame Marneffe, in short, had so bewitched the old beau, that
he<br>
 really believed she was sinning for the first time for his sake,
and<br>
 that he had inspired such a passion as had led her to this
breach of<br>
 duty. She told him that the wretch Marneffe had neglected her
after<br>
 they had been three days married, and for the most odious
reasons.<br>
 Since then she had lived as innocently as a girl; marriage had
seemed<br>
 to her so horrible. This was the cause of her present
melancholy.</p>

<p>"If love should prove to be like marriage----" said she in
tears.</p>

<p>These insinuating lies, with which almost every woman in
Valerie's<br>
 predicament is ready, gave the Baron distant visions of the
roses of<br>
 the seventh heaven. And so Valerie coquetted with her lover,
while the<br>
 artist and Hortense were impatiently awaiting the moment when
the<br>
 Baroness should have given the girl her last kiss and
blessing.</p>

<p>At seven in the morning the Baron, perfectly happy--for his
Valerie<br>
 was at once the most guileless of girls and the most consummate
of<br>
 demons--went back to release his son and Celestine from their
duties.<br>
 All the dancers, for the most part strangers, had taken
possession of<br>
 the territory, as they do at every wedding-ball, and were
keeping up<br>
 the endless figures of the cotillions, while the gamblers were
still<br>
 crowding round the <i>bouillotte</i> tables, and old Crevel had
won six<br>
 thousand francs.</p>

<p>The morning papers, carried round the town, contained this
paragraph<br>
 in the Paris article:--</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"The marriage was celebrated this morning, at the Church of
Saint-<br>
 Thomas d'Aquin, between Monsieur le Comte Steinbock and<br>
 Mademoiselle Hortense Hulot, daughter of Baron Hulot d'Ervy,<br>
 Councillor of State, and a Director at the War Office; niece
of<br>
 the famous General Comte de Forzheim. The ceremony attracted
a<br>
 large gathering. There were present some of the most
distinguished<br>
 artists of the day: Leon de Lora, Joseph Bridau, Stidmann,
and<br>
 Bixiou; the magnates of the War Office, of the Council of
State,<br>
 and many members of the two Chambers; also the most
distinguished<br>
 of the Polish exiles living in Paris: Counts Paz, Laginski,
and<br>
 others.</p>

<p>"Monsieur le Comte Wenceslas Steinbock is grandnephew to
the<br>
 famous general who served under Charles XII., King of Sweden.
The<br>
 young Count, having taken part in the Polish rebellion, found
a<br>
 refuge in France, where his well-earned fame as a sculptor
has<br>
 procured him a patent of naturalization."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And so, in spite of the Baron's cruel lack of money, nothing
was<br>
 lacking that public opinion could require, not even the
trumpeting of<br>
 the newspapers over his daughter's marriage, which was
solemnized in<br>
 the same way, in every particular, as his son's had been to<br>
 Mademoiselle Crevel. This display moderated the reports current
as to<br>
 the Baron's financial position, while the fortune assigned to
his<br>
 daughter explained the need for having borrowed money.</p>

<p><br>
 Here ends what is, in a way, the introduction to this story. It
is to<br>
 the drama that follows that the premise is to a syllogism, what
the<br>
 prologue is to a classical tragedy.</p>

<p>In Paris, when a woman determines to make a business, a trade,
of her<br>
 beauty, it does not follow that she will make a fortune.
Lovely<br>
 creatures may be found there, and full of wit, who are in
wretched<br>
 circumstances, ending in misery a life begun in pleasure. And
this is<br>
 why. It is not enough merely to accept the shameful life of
a<br>
 courtesan with a view to earning its profits, and at the same
time to<br>
 bear the simple garb of a respectable middle-class wife. Vice
does not<br>
 triumph so easily; it resembles genius in so far that they both
need a<br>
 concurrence of favorable conditions to develop the coalition
of<br>
 fortune and gifts. Eliminate the strange prologue of the
Revolution,<br>
 and the Emperor would never have existed; he would have been no
more<br>
 than a second edition of Fabert. Venal beauty, if it finds
no<br>
 amateurs, no celebrity, no cross of dishonor earned by
squandering<br>
 men's fortunes, is Correggio in a hay-loft, is genius starving
in a<br>
 garret. Lais, in Paris, must first and foremost find a rich man
mad<br>
 enough to pay her price. She must keep up a very elegant style,
for<br>
 this is her shop-sign; she must be sufficiently well bred to
flatter<br>
 the vanity of her lovers; she must have the brilliant wit of a
Sophie<br>
 Arnould, which diverts the apathy of rich men; finally, she
must<br>
 arouse the passions of libertines by appearing to be mistress to
one<br>
 man only who is envied by the rest.</p>

<p>These conditions, which a woman of that class calls being in
luck, are<br>
 difficult to combine in Paris, although it is a city of
millionaires,<br>
 of idlers, of used-up and capricious men.</p>

<p>Providence has, no doubt, vouchsafed protection to clerks and
middle-<br>
 class citizens, for whom obstacles of this kind are at least
double in<br>
 the sphere in which they move. At the same time, there are
enough<br>
 Madame Marneffes in Paris to allow of our taking Valerie to
figure as<br>
 a type in this picture of manners. Some of these women yield to
the<br>
 double pressure of a genuine passion and of hard necessity,
like<br>
 Madame Colleville, who was for long attached to one of the
famous<br>
 orators of the left, Keller the banker. Others are spurred by
vanity,<br>
 like Madame de la Baudraye, who remained almost respectable in
spite<br>
 of her elopement with Lousteau. Some, again, are led astray by
the<br>
 love of fine clothes, and some by the impossibility of keeping a
house<br>
 going on obviously too narrow means. The stinginess of the
State--or<br>
 of Parliament--leads to many disasters and to much
corruption.</p>

<p>At the present moment the laboring classes are the fashionable
object<br>
 of compassion; they are being murdered--it is said--by the<br>
 manufacturing capitalist; but the Government is a hundred times
harder<br>
 than the meanest tradesman, it carries its economy in the
article of<br>
 salaries to absolute folly. If you work harder, the merchant
will pay<br>
 you more in proportion; but what does the State do for its crowd
of<br>
 obscure and devoted toilers?</p>

<p>In a married woman it is an inexcusable crime when she wanders
from<br>
 the path of honor; still, there are degrees even in such a case.
Some<br>
 women, far from being depraved, conceal their fall and remain to
all<br>
 appearances quite respectable, like those two just referred to,
while<br>
 others add to their fault the disgrace of speculation. Thus
Madame<br>
 Marneffe is, as it were, the type of those ambitious married<br>
 courtesans who from the first accept depravity with all its<br>
 consequences, and determine to make a fortune while taking
their<br>
 pleasure, perfectly unscrupulous as to the means. But almost
always a<br>
 woman like Madame Marneffe has a husband who is her confederate
and<br>
 accomplice. These Machiavellis in petticoats are the most
dangerous of<br>
 the sisterhood; of every evil class of Parisian woman, they are
the<br>
 worst.</p>

<p>A mere courtesan--a Josepha, a Malaga, a Madame Schontz, a
Jenny<br>
 Cadine--carries in her frank dishonor a warning signal as
conspicuous<br>
 as the red lamp of a house of ill-fame or the flaring lights of
a<br>
 gambling hell. A man knows that they light him to his ruin.</p>

<p>But mealy-mouthed propriety, the semblance of virtue, the
hypocritical<br>
 ways of a married woman who never allows anything to be seen but
the<br>
 vulgar needs of the household, and affects to refuse every kind
of<br>
 extravagance, leads to silent ruin, dumb disaster, which is all
the<br>
 more startling because, though condoned, it remains unaccounted
for.<br>
 It is the ignoble bill of daily expenses and not gay dissipation
that<br>
 devours the largest fortune. The father of a family ruins
himself<br>
 ingloriously, and the great consolation of gratified vanity is
wanting<br>
 in his misery.</p>

<p>This little sermon will go like a javelin to the heart of many
a home.<br>
 Madame Marneffes are to be seen in every sphere of social life,
even<br>
 at Court; for Valerie is a melancholy fact, modeled from the
life in<br>
 the smallest details. And, alas! the portrait will not cure any
man of<br>
 the folly of loving these sweetly-smiling angels, with pensive
looks<br>
 and candid faces, whose heart is a cash-box.</p>

<p>About three years after Hortense's marriage, in 1841, Baron
Hulot<br>
 d'Ervy was supposed to have sown his wild oats, to have "put up
his<br>
 horses," to quote the expression used by Louis XV.'s head
surgeon, and<br>
 yet Madame Marneffe was costing him twice as much as Josepha had
ever<br>
 cost him. Still, Valerie, though always nicely dressed, affected
the<br>
 simplicity of a subordinate official's wife; she kept her luxury
for<br>
 her dressing-gowns, her home wear. She thus sacrificed her
Parisian<br>
 vanity to her dear Hector. At the theatre, however, she
always<br>
 appeared in a pretty bonnet and a dress of extreme elegance; and
the<br>
 Baron took her in a carriage to a private box.</p>

<p>Her rooms, the whole of the second floor of a modern house in
the Rue<br>
 Vanneau, between a fore-court and a garden, was redolent of<br>
 respectability. All its luxury was in good chintz hangings
and<br>
 handsome convenient furniture.</p>

<p>Her bedroom, indeed, was the exception, and rich with such
profusion<br>
 as Jenny Cadine or Madame Schontz might have displayed. There
were<br>
 lace curtains, cashmere hangings, brocade portieres, a set of
chimney<br>
 ornaments modeled by Stidmann, a glass cabinet filled with
dainty<br>
 nicknacks. Hulot could not bear to see his Valerie in a bower
of<br>
 inferior magnificence to the dunghill of gold and pearls owned
by a<br>
 Josepha. The drawing-room was furnished with red damask, and
the<br>
 dining-room had carved oak panels. But the Baron, carried away
by his<br>
 wish to have everything in keeping, had at the end of six
months,<br>
 added solid luxury to mere fashion, and had given her
handsome<br>
 portable property, as, for instance, a service of plate that was
to<br>
 cost more than twenty-four thousand francs.</p>

<p>Madame Marneffe's house had in a couple of years achieved a
reputation<br>
 for being a very pleasant one. Gambling went on there. Valerie
herself<br>
 was soon spoken of as an agreeable and witty woman. To account
for her<br>
 change of style, a rumor was set going of an immense legacy
bequeathed<br>
 to her by her "natural father," Marshal Montcornet, and left in
trust.</p>

<p>With an eye to the future, Valerie had added religious to
social<br>
 hypocrisy. Punctual at the Sunday services, she enjoyed all the
honors<br>
 due to the pious. She carried the bag for the offertory, she was
a<br>
 member of a charitable association, presented bread for the
sacrament,<br>
 and did some good among the poor, all at Hector's expense.
Thus<br>
 everything about the house was extremely seemly. And a great
many<br>
 persons maintained that her friendship with the Baron was
entirely<br>
 innocent, supporting the view by the gentleman's mature age,
and<br>
 ascribing to him a Platonic liking for Madame Marneffe's
pleasant wit,<br>
 charming manners, and conversation--such a liking as that of the
late<br>
 lamented Louis XVIII. for a well-turned note.</p>

<p>The Baron always withdrew with the other company at about
midnight,<br>
 and came back a quarter of an hour later.</p>

<p>The secret of this secrecy was as follows. The lodge-keepers
of the<br>
 house were a Monsieur and Madame Olivier, who, under the
Baron's<br>
 patronage, had been promoted from their humble and not very
lucrative<br>
 post in the Rue du Doyenne to the highly-paid and handsome one
in the<br>
 Rue Vanneau. Now, Madame Olivier, formerly a needlewoman in
the<br>
 household of Charles X., who had fallen in the world with
the<br>
 legitimate branch, had three children. The eldest, an
under-clerk in a<br>
 notary's office, was object of his parents' adoration. This
Benjamin,<br>
 for six years in danger of being drawn for the army, was on the
point<br>
 of being interrupted in his legal career, when Madame
Marneffe<br>
 contrived to have him declared exempt for one of those
little<br>
 malformations which the Examining Board can always discern
when<br>
 requested in a whisper by some power in the ministry. So
Olivier,<br>
 formerly a huntsman to the King, and his wife would have
crucified the<br>
 Lord again for the Baron or for Madame Marneffe.</p>

<p>What could the world have to say? It knew nothing of the
former<br>
 episode of the Brazilian, Monsieur Montes de Montejanos--it
could say<br>
 nothing. Besides, the world is very indulgent to the mistress of
a<br>
 house where amusement is to be found.</p>

<p>And then to all her charms Valerie added the highly-prized
advantage<br>
 of being an occult power. Claude Vignon, now secretary to
Marshal the<br>
 Prince de Wissembourg, and dreaming of promotion to the Council
of<br>
 State as a Master of Appeals, was constantly seen in her rooms,
to<br>
 which came also some Deputies--good fellows and gamblers.
Madame<br>
 Marneffe had got her circle together with prudent deliberation;
only<br>
 men whose opinions and habits agreed foregathered there, men
whose<br>
 interest it was to hold together and to proclaim the many merits
of<br>
 the lady of the house. Scandal is the true Holy Alliance in
Paris.<br>
 Take that as an axiom. Interests invariably fall asunder in the
end;<br>
 vicious natures can always agree.</p>

<p>Within three months of settling in the Rue Vanneau, Madame
Marneffe<br>
 had entertained Monsieur Crevel, who by that time was Mayor of
his<br>
 <i>arrondissement</i> and Officer of the Legion of Honor. Crevel
had<br>
 hesitated; he would have to give up the famous uniform of the
National<br>
 Guard in which he strutted at the Tuileries, believing himself
quite<br>
 as much a soldier as the Emperor himself; but ambition, urged
by<br>
 Madame Marneffe, had proved stronger than vanity. Then Monsieur
le<br>
 Maire had considered his connection with Mademoiselle
Heloise<br>
 Brisetout as quite incompatible with his political position.</p>

<p>Indeed, long before his accession to the civic chair of the
Mayoralty,<br>
 his gallant intimacies had been wrapped in the deepest mystery.
But,<br>
 as the reader may have guessed, Crevel had soon purchased the
right of<br>
 taking his revenge, as often as circumstances allowed, for
having been<br>
 bereft of Josepha, at the cost of a bond bearing six thousand
francs<br>
 of interest in the name of Valerie Fortin, wife of Sieur
Marneffe, for<br>
 her sole and separate use. Valerie, inheriting perhaps from her
mother<br>
 the special acumen of the kept woman, read the character of
her<br>
 grotesque adorer at a glance. The phrase "I never had a lady for
a<br>
 mistress," spoken by Crevel to Lisbeth, and repeated by Lisbeth
to her<br>
 dear Valerie, had been handsomely discounted in the bargain by
which<br>
 she got her six thousand francs a year in five per cents. And
since<br>
 then she had never allowed her prestige to grow less in the eyes
of<br>
 Cesar Birotteau's erewhile bagman.</p>

<p>Crevel himself had married for money the daughter of a miller
of la<br>
 Brie, an only child indeed, whose inheritance constituted
three-<br>
 quarters of his fortune; for when retail-dealers grow rich, it
is<br>
 generally not so much by trade as through some alliance between
the<br>
 shop and rural thrift. A large proportion of the farmers,
corn-<br>
 factors, dairy-keepers, and market-gardeners in the neighborhood
of<br>
 Paris, dream of the glories of the desk for their daughters, and
look<br>
 upon a shopkeeper, a jeweler, or a money-changer as a son-in-law
after<br>
 their own heart, in preference to a notary or an attorney,
whose<br>
 superior social position is a ground of suspicion; they are
afraid of<br>
 being scorned in the future by these citizen bigwigs.</p>

<p>Madame Crevel, ugly, vulgar, and silly, had given her husband
no<br>
 pleasures but those of paternity; she died young. Her
libertine<br>
 husband, fettered at the beginning of his commercial career by
the<br>
 necessity for working, and held in thrall by want of money, had
led<br>
 the life of Tantalus. Thrown in--as he phrased it--with the
most<br>
 elegant women in Paris, he let them out of the shop with
servile<br>
 homage, while admiring their grace, their way of wearing the
fashions,<br>
 and all the nameless charms of what is called breeding. To rise
to the<br>
 level of one of these fairies of the drawing-room was a desire
formed<br>
 in his youth, but buried in the depths of his heart. Thus to win
the<br>
 favors of Madame Marneffe was to him not merely the realization
of his<br>
 chimera, but, as has been shown, a point of pride, of vanity, of
self-<br>
 satisfaction. His ambition grew with success; his brain was
turned<br>
 with elation; and when the mind is captivated, the heart feels
more<br>
 keenly, every gratification is doubled.</p>

<p>Also, it must be said that Madame Marneffe offered to Crevel
a<br>
 refinement of pleasure of which he had no idea; neither Josepha
nor<br>
 Heloise had loved him; and Madame Marneffe thought it necessary
to<br>
 deceive him thoroughly, for this man, she saw, would prove
an<br>
 inexhaustible till. The deceptions of a venal passion are
more<br>
 delightful than the real thing. True love is mixed up with
birdlike<br>
 squabbles, in which the disputants wound each other to the
quick; but<br>
 a quarrel without animus is, on the contrary, a piece of
flattery to<br>
 the dupe's conceit.</p>

<p>The rare interviews granted to Crevel kept his passion at
white heat.<br>
 He was constantly blocked by Valerie's virtuous severity; she
acted<br>
 remorse, and wondered what her father must be thinking of her in
the<br>
 paradise of the brave. Again and again he had to contend with a
sort<br>
 of coldness, which the cunning slut made him believe he had
overcome<br>
 by seeming to surrender to the man's crazy passion; and then, as
if<br>
 ashamed, she entrenched herself once more in her pride of<br>
 respectability and airs of virtue, just like an Englishwoman,
neither<br>
 more nor less; and she always crushed her Crevel under the
weight of<br>
 her dignity--for Crevel had, in the first instance, swallowed
her<br>
 pretensions to virtue.</p>

<p>In short, Valerie had special veins of affections which made
her<br>
 equally indispensable to Crevel and to the Baron. Before the
world she<br>
 displayed the attractive combination of modest and pensive
innocence,<br>
 of irreproachable propriety, with a bright humor enhanced by
the<br>
 suppleness, the grace and softness of the Creole; but in a
<i>tete-a-<br>
</i> <i>tete</i> she would outdo any courtesan; she was
audacious, amusing, and<br>
 full of original inventiveness. Such a contrast is irresistible
to a<br>
 man of the Crevel type; he is flattered by believing himself
sole<br>
 author of the comedy, thinking it is performed for his benefit
alone,<br>
 and he laughs at the exquisite hypocrisy while admiring the
hypocrite.</p>

<p><br>
 Valerie had taken entire possession of Baron Hulot; she had
persuaded<br>
 him to grow old by one of those subtle touches of flattery
which<br>
 reveal the diabolical wit of women like her. In all
evergreen<br>
 constitutions a moment arrives when the truth suddenly comes
out, as<br>
 in a besieged town which puts a good face on affairs as long
as<br>
 possible. Valerie, foreseeing the approaching collapse of the
old beau<br>
 of the Empire, determined to forestall it.</p>

<p>"Why give yourself so much bother, my dear old veteran?" said
she one<br>
 day, six months after their doubly adulterous union. "Do you
want to<br>
 be flirting? To be unfaithful to me? I assure you, I should like
you<br>
 better without your make-up. Oblige me by giving up all your<br>
 artificial charms. Do you suppose that it is for two sous' worth
of<br>
 polish on your boots that I love you? For your india-rubber
belt, your<br>
 strait-waistcoat, and your false hair? And then, the older you
look,<br>
 the less need I fear seeing my Hulot carried off by a
rival."</p>

<p>And Hulot, trusting to Madame Marneffe's heavenly friendship
as much<br>
 as to her love, intending, too, to end his days with her, had
taken<br>
 this confidential hint, and ceased to dye his whiskers and hair.
After<br>
 this touching declaration from his Valerie, handsome Hector made
his<br>
 appearance one morning perfectly white. Madame Marneffe could
assure<br>
 him that she had a hundred times detected the white line of the
growth<br>
 of the hair.</p>

<p>"And white hair suits your face to perfection," said she; "it
softens<br>
 it. You look a thousand times better, quite charming."</p>

<p>The Baron, once started on this path of reform, gave up his
leather<br>
 waistcoat and stays; he threw off all his bracing. His stomach
fell<br>
 and increased in size. The oak became a tower, and the heaviness
of<br>
 his movements was all the more alarming because the Baron
grew<br>
 immensely older by playing the part of Louis XII. His eyebrows
were<br>
 still black, and left a ghostly reminiscence of Handsome Hulot,
as<br>
 sometimes on the wall of some feudal building a faint trace
of<br>
 sculpture remains to show what the castle was in the days of
its<br>
 glory. This discordant detail made his eyes, still bright
and<br>
 youthful, all the more remarkable in his tanned face, because it
had<br>
 so long been ruddy with the florid hues of a Rubens; and now a
certain<br>
 discoloration and the deep tension of the wrinkles betrayed
the<br>
 efforts of a passion at odds with natural decay. Hulot was now
one of<br>
 those stalwart ruins in which virile force asserts itself by
tufts of<br>
 hair in the ears and nostrils and on the fingers, as moss grows
on the<br>
 almost eternal monuments of the Roman Empire.</p>

<p>How had Valerie contrived to keep Crevel and Hulot side by
side, each<br>
 tied to an apron-string, when the vindictive Mayor only longed
to<br>
 triumph openly over Hulot? Without immediately giving an answer
to<br>
 this question, which the course of the story will supply, it may
be<br>
 said that Lisbeth and Valerie had contrived a powerful piece
of<br>
 machinery which tended to this result. Marneffe, as he saw his
wife<br>
 improved in beauty by the setting in which she was enthroned,
like the<br>
 sun at the centre of the sidereal system, appeared, in the eyes
of the<br>
 world, to have fallen in love with her again himself; he was
quite<br>
 crazy about her. Now, though his jealousy made him somewhat of
a<br>
 marplot, it gave enhanced value to Valerie's favors.
Marneffe<br>
 meanwhile showed a blind confidence in his chief, which
degenerated<br>
 into ridiculous complaisance. The only person whom he really
would not<br>
 stand was Crevel.</p>

<p>Marneffe, wrecked by the debauchery of great cities, described
by<br>
 Roman authors, though modern decency has no name for it, was
as<br>
 hideous as an anatomical figure in wax. But this disease on
feet,<br>
 clothed in good broadcloth, encased his lathlike legs in
elegant<br>
 trousers. The hollow chest was scented with fine linen, and
musk<br>
 disguised the odors of rotten humanity. This hideous specimen
of<br>
 decaying vice, trotting in red heels--for Valerie dressed the
man as<br>
 beseemed his income, his cross, and his appointment--horrified
Crevel,<br>
 who could not meet the colorless eyes of the Government
clerk.<br>
 Marneffe was an incubus to the Mayor. And the mean rascal, aware
of<br>
 the strange power conferred on him by Lisbeth and his wife, was
amused<br>
 by it; he played on it as on an instrument; and cards being the
last<br>
 resource of a mind as completely played out as the body, he
plucked<br>
 Crevel again and again, the Mayor thinking himself bound to<br>
 subserviency to the worthy official whom <i>he was
cheating.</i></p>

<p>Seeing Crevel a mere child in the hands of that hideous and
atrocious<br>
 mummy, of whose utter vileness the Mayor knew nothing; and
seeing him,<br>
 yet more, an object of deep contempt to Valerie, who made game
of<br>
 Crevel as of some mountebank, the Baron apparently thought him
so<br>
 impossible as a rival that he constantly invited him to
dinner.</p>

<p>Valerie, protected by two lovers on guard, and by a jealous
husband,<br>
 attracted every eye, and excited every desire in the circle she
shone<br>
 upon. And thus, while keeping up appearances, she had, in the
course<br>
 of three years, achieved the most difficult conditions of the
success<br>
 a courtesan most cares for and most rarely attains, even with
the help<br>
 of audacity and the glitter of an existence in the light of the
sun.<br>
 Valerie's beauty, formerly buried in the mud of the Rue du
Doyenne,<br>
 now, like a well-cut diamond exquisitely set by Chanor, was
worth more<br>
 than its real value--it could break hearts. Claude Vignon
adored<br>
 Valerie in secret.</p>

<p>This retrospective explanation, quite necessary after the
lapse of<br>
 three years, shows Valerie's balance-sheet. Now for that of
her<br>
 partner, Lisbeth.</p>

<p>Lisbeth Fischer filled the place in the Marneffe household of
a<br>
 relation who combines the functions of a lady companion and
a<br>
 housekeeper; but she suffered from none of the humiliations
which, for<br>
 the most part, weigh upon the women who are so unhappy as to
be<br>
 obliged to fill these ambiguous situations. Lisbeth and
Valerie<br>
 offered the touching spectacle of one of those friendships
between<br>
 women, so cordial and so improbable, that men, always too
keen-tongued<br>
 in Paris, forthwith slander them. The contrast between Lisbeth's
dry<br>
 masculine nature and Valerie's creole prettiness encouraged
calumny.<br>
 And Madame Marneffe had unconsciously given weight to the
scandal by<br>
 the care she took of her friend, with matrimonial views, which
were,<br>
 as will be seen, to complete Lisbeth's revenge.</p>

<p>An immense change had taken place in Cousin Betty; and
Valerie, who<br>
 wanted to smarten her, had turned it to the best account. The
strange<br>
 woman had submitted to stays, and laced tightly, she used
bandoline to<br>
 keep her hair smooth, wore her gowns as the dressmaker sent them
home,<br>
 neat little boots, and gray silk stockings, all of which were
included<br>
 in Valerie's bills, and paid for by the gentleman in possession.
Thus<br>
 furbished up, and wearing the yellow cashmere shawl, Lisbeth
would<br>
 have been unrecognizable by any one who had not seen her for
three<br>
 years.</p>

<p>This other diamond--a black diamond, the rarest of all--cut by
a<br>
 skilled hand, and set as best became her, was appreciated at her
full<br>
 value by certain ambitious clerks. Any one seeing her for the
first<br>
 time might have shuddered involuntarily at the look of poetic
wildness<br>
 which the clever Valerie had succeeded in bringing out by the
arts of<br>
 dress in this Bleeding Nun, framing the ascetic olive face in
thick<br>
 bands of hair as black as the fiery eyes, and making the most of
the<br>
 rigid, slim figure. Lisbeth, like a Virgin by Cranach or Van
Eyck, or<br>
 a Byzantine Madonna stepped out of its frame, had all the
stiffness,<br>
 the precision of those mysterious figures, the more modern
cousins of<br>
 Isis and her sister goddesses sheathed in marble folds by
Egyptian<br>
 sculptors. It was granite, basalt, porphyry, with life and
movement.</p>

<p>Saved from want for the rest of her life, Lisbeth was most
amiable;<br>
 wherever she dined she brought merriment. And the Baron paid the
rent<br>
 of her little apartment, furnished, as we know, with the
leavings of<br>
 her friend Valerie's former boudoir and bedroom.</p>

<p>"I began," she would say, "as a hungry nanny goat, and I am
ending as<br>
 a <i>lionne</i>."</p>

<p>She still worked for Monsieur Rivet at the more elaborate
kinds of<br>
 gold-trimming, merely, as she said, not to lose her time. At the
same<br>
 time, she was, as we shall see, very full of business; but it
is<br>
 inherent in the nature of country-folks never to give up
bread-<br>
 winning; in this they are like the Jews.</p>

<p>Every morning, very early, Cousin Betty went off to market
with the<br>
 cook. It was part of Lisbeth's scheme that the house-book, which
was<br>
 ruining Baron Hulot, was to enrich her dear Valerie--as it did
indeed.</p>

<p>Is there a housewife who, since 1838, has not suffered from
the evil<br>
 effects of Socialist doctrines diffused among the lower classes
by<br>
 incendiary writers? In every household the plague of servants
is<br>
 nowadays the worst of financial afflictions. With very few
exceptions,<br>
 who ought to be rewarded with the Montyon prize, the cook, male
or<br>
 female, is a domestic robber, a thief taking wages, and
perfectly<br>
 barefaced, with the Government for a fence, developing the
tendency to<br>
 dishonesty, which is almost authorized in the cook by the
time-honored<br>
 jest as to the "handle of the basket." The women who formerly
picked<br>
 up their forty sous to buy a lottery ticket now take fifty
francs to<br>
 put into the savings bank. And the smug Puritans who amuse
themselves<br>
 in France with philanthropic experiments fancy that they are
making<br>
 the common people moral!</p>

<p>Between the market and the master's table the servants have
their<br>
 secret toll, and the municipality of Paris is less sharp in
collecting<br>
 the city-dues than the servants are in taking theirs on every
single<br>
 thing. To say nothing of fifty per cent charged on every form of
food,<br>
 they demand large New Year's premiums from the tradesmen. The
best<br>
 class of dealers tremble before this occult power, and subsidize
it<br>
 without a word--coachmakers, jewelers, tailors, and all. If
any<br>
 attempt is made to interfere with them, the servants reply
with<br>
 impudent retorts, or revenge themselves by the costly blunders
of<br>
 assumed clumsiness; and in these days they inquire into their
master's<br>
 character as, formerly, the master inquired into theirs. This
mischief<br>
 is now really at its height, and the law-courts are beginning to
take<br>
 cognizance of it; but in vain, for it cannot be remedied but by
a law<br>
 which shall compel domestic servants, like laborers, to have a
pass-<br>
 book as a guarantee of conduct. Then the evil will vanish as if
by<br>
 magic. If every servant were obliged to show his pass-book, and
if<br>
 masters were required to state in it the cause of his dismissal,
this<br>
 would certainly prove a powerful check to the evil.</p>

<p>The men who are giving their attentions to the politics of the
day<br>
 know not to what lengths the depravity of the lower classes has
gone.<br>
 Statistics are silent as to the startling number of working men
of<br>
 twenty who marry cooks of between forty and fifty enriched by
robbery.<br>
 We shudder to think of the result of such unions from the three
points<br>
 of view of increasing crime, degeneracy of the race, and
miserable<br>
 households.</p>

<p>As to the mere financial mischief that results from
domestic<br>
 peculation, that too is immense from a political point of view.
Life<br>
 being made to cost double, any superfluity becomes impossible in
most<br>
 households. Now superfluity means half the trade of the world,
as it<br>
 is half the elegance of life. Books and flowers are to many
persons as<br>
 necessary as bread.</p>

<p>Lisbeth, well aware of this dreadful scourge of Parisian
households,<br>
 determined to manage Valerie's, promising her every assistance
in the<br>
 terrible scene when the two women had sworn to be like sisters.
So she<br>
 had brought from the depths of the Vosges a humble relation on
her<br>
 mother's side, a very pious and honest soul, who had been cook
to the<br>
 Bishop of Nancy. Fearing, however, her inexperience of Paris
ways, and<br>
 yet more the evil counsel which wrecks such fragile virtue, at
first<br>
 Lisbeth always went to market with Mathurine, and tried to teach
her<br>
 what to buy. To know the real prices of things and command
the<br>
 salesman's respect; to purchase unnecessary delicacies, such as
fish,<br>
 only when they were cheap; to be well informed as to the price
current<br>
 of groceries and provisions, so as to buy when prices are low
in<br>
 anticipation of a rise,--all this housekeeping skill is in
Paris<br>
 essential to domestic economy. As Mathurine got good wages and
many<br>
 presents, she liked the house well enough to be glad to drive
good<br>
 bargains. And by this time Lisbeth had made her quite a match
for<br>
 herself, sufficiently experienced and trustworthy to be sent to
market<br>
 alone, unless Valerie was giving a dinner--which, in fact, was
not<br>
 unfrequently the case. And this was how it came about.</p>

<p>The Baron had at first observed the strictest decorum; but his
passion<br>
 for Madame Marneffe had ere long become so vehement, so greedy,
that<br>
 he would never quit her if he could help it. At first he dined
there<br>
 four times a week; then he thought it delightful to dine with
her<br>
 every day. Six months after his daughter's marriage he was
paying her<br>
 two thousand francs a month for his board. Madame Marneffe
invited any<br>
 one her dear Baron wished to entertain. The dinner was always
arranged<br>
 for six; he could bring in three unexpected guests. Lisbeth's
economy<br>
 enabled her to solve the extraordinary problem of keeping up the
table<br>
 in the best style for a thousand francs a month, giving the
other<br>
 thousand to Madame Marneffe. Valerie's dress being chiefly paid
for by<br>
 Crevel and the Baron, the two women saved another thousand
francs a<br>
 month on this.</p>

<p>And so this pure and innocent being had already accumulated a
hundred<br>
 and fifty thousand francs in savings. She had capitalized her
income<br>
 and monthly bonus, and swelled the amount by enormous interest,
due to<br>
 Crevel's liberality in allowing his "little Duchess" to invest
her<br>
 money in partnership with him in his financial operations.
Crevel had<br>
 taught Valerie the slang and the procedure of the money market,
and,<br>
 like every Parisian woman, she had soon outstripped her
master.<br>
 Lisbeth, who never spent a sou of her twelve hundred francs,
whose<br>
 rent and dress were given to her, and who never put her hand in
her<br>
 pocket, had likewise a small capital of five or six thousand
francs,<br>
 of which Crevel took fatherly care.</p>

<p>At the same time, two such lovers were a heavy burthen on
Valerie. On<br>
 the day when this drama reopens, Valerie, spurred by one of
those<br>
 incidents which have the effect in life that the ringing of a
bell has<br>
 in inducing a swarm of bees to settle, went up to Lisbeth's
rooms to<br>
 give vent to one of those comforting lamentations--a sort of
cigarette<br>
 blown off from the tongue--by which women alleviate the minor
miseries<br>
 of life.</p>

<p>"Oh, Lisbeth, my love, two hours of Crevel this morning! It
is<br>
 crushing! How I wish I could send you in my place!"</p>

<p>"That, unluckily, is impossible," said Lisbeth, smiling. "I
shall die<br>
 a maid."</p>

<p>"Two old men lovers! Really, I am ashamed sometimes! If my
poor mother<br>
 could see me."</p>

<p>"You are mistaking me for Crevel!" said Lisbeth.</p>

<p>"Tell me, my little Betty, do you not despise me?"</p>

<p>"Oh! if I had but been pretty, what adventures I would have
had!"<br>
 cried Lisbeth. "That is your justification."</p>

<p>"But you would have acted only at the dictates of your heart,"
said<br>
 Madame Marneffe, with a sigh.</p>

<p>"Pooh! Marneffe is a dead man they have forgotten to bury,"
replied<br>
 Lisbeth. "The Baron is as good as your husband; Crevel is your
adorer;<br>
 it seems to me that you are quite in order--like every other
married<br>
 woman."</p>

<p>"No, it is not that, dear, adorable thing; that is not where
the shoe<br>
 pinches; you do not choose to understand."</p>

<p>"Yes, I do," said Lisbeth. "The unexpressed factor is part of
my<br>
 revenge; what can I do? I am working it out."</p>

<p>"I love Wenceslas so that I am positively growing thin, and I
can<br>
 never see him," said Valerie, throwing up her arms. "Hulot asks
him to<br>
 dinner, and my artist declines. He does not know that I idolize
him,<br>
 the wretch! What is his wife after all? Fine flesh! Yes, she
is<br>
 handsome, but I--I know myself--I am worse!"</p>

<p>"Be quite easy, my child, he will come," said Lisbeth, in the
tone of<br>
 a nurse to an impatient child. "He shall."</p>

<p>"But when?"</p>

<p>"This week perhaps."</p>

<p>"Give me a kiss."</p>

<p>As may be seen, these two women were but one. Everything
Valerie did,<br>
 even her most reckless actions, her pleasures, her little sulks,
were<br>
 decided on after serious deliberation between them.</p>

<p>Lisbeth, strangely excited by this harlot existence, advised
Valerie<br>
 on every step, and pursued her course of revenge with pitiless
logic.<br>
 She really adored Valerie; she had taken her to be her child,
her<br>
 friend, her love; she found her docile, as Creoles are, yielding
from<br>
 voluptuous indolence; she chattered with her morning after
morning<br>
 with more pleasure than with Wenceslas; they could laugh
together over<br>
 the mischief they plotted, and over the folly of men, and count
up the<br>
 swelling interest on their respective savings.</p>

<p><br>
 Indeed in this new enterprise and new affection, Lisbeth had
found<br>
 food for her activity that was far more satisfying than her
insane<br>
 passion for Wenceslas. The joys of gratified hatred are the
fiercest<br>
 and strongest the heart can know. Love is the gold, hatred the
iron of<br>
 the mine of feeling that lies buried in us. And then, Valerie
was, to<br>
 Lisbeth, Beauty in all its glory--the beauty she worshiped, as
we<br>
 worship what we have not, beauty far more plastic to her hand
than<br>
 that of Wenceslas, who had always been cold to her and
distant.</p>

<p>At the end of nearly three years, Lisbeth was beginning to
perceive<br>
 the progress of the underground mine on which she was expending
her<br>
 life and concentrating her mind. Lisbeth planned, Madame
Marneffe<br>
 acted. Madame Marneffe was the axe, Lisbeth was the hand the
wielded<br>
 it, and that hand was rapidly demolishing the family which was
every<br>
 day more odious to her; for we can hate more and more, just as,
when<br>
 we love, we love better every day.</p>

<p>Love and hatred are feelings that feed on themselves; but of
the two,<br>
 hatred has the longer vitality. Love is restricted within limits
of<br>
 power; it derives its energies from life and from lavishness.
Hatred<br>
 is like death, like avarice; it is, so to speak, an active<br>
 abstraction, above beings and things.</p>

<p>Lisbeth, embarked on the existence that was natural to her,
expended<br>
 in it all her faculties; governing, like the Jesuits, by
occult<br>
 influences. The regeneration of her person was equally complete;
her<br>
 face was radiant. Lisbeth dreamed of becoming Madame la
Marechale<br>
 Hulot.</p>

<p>This little scene, in which the two friends had bluntly
uttered their<br>
 ideas without any circumlocution in expressing them, took
place<br>
 immediately on Lisbeth's return from market, whither she had
been to<br>
 procure the materials for an elegant dinner. Marneffe, who hoped
to<br>
 get Coquet's place, was to entertain him and the virtuous
Madame<br>
 Coquet, and Valerie hoped to persuade Hulot, that very evening,
to<br>
 consider the head-clerk's resignation.</p>

<p>Lisbeth dressed to go to the Baroness, with whom she was to
dine.</p>

<p>"You will come back in time to make tea for us, my Betty?"
said<br>
 Valerie.</p>

<p>"I hope so."</p>

<p>"You hope so--why? Have you come to sleeping with Adeline to
drink her<br>
 tears while she is asleep?"</p>

<p>"If only I could!" said Lisbeth, laughing. "I would not
refuse. She is<br>
 expiating her happiness--and I am glad, for I remember our young
days.<br>
 It is my turn now. She will be in the mire, and I shall be
Comtesse de<br>
 Forzheim!"</p>

<p>Lisbeth set out for the Rue Plumet, where she now went as to
the<br>
 theatre--to indulge her emotions.</p>

<p>The residence Hulot had found for his wife consisted of a
large, bare<br>
 entrance-room, a drawing-room, and a bed and dressing-room.
The<br>
 dining-room was next the drawing-room on one side. Two servants'
rooms<br>
 and a kitchen on the third floor completed the accommodation,
which<br>
 was not unworthy of a Councillor of State, high up in the War
Office.<br>
 The house, the court-yard, and the stairs were extremely
handsome.</p>

<p>The Baroness, who had to furnish her drawing-room, bed-room,
and<br>
 dining-room with the relics of her splendor, had brought away
the best<br>
 of the remains from the house in the Rue de l'Universite.
Indeed, the<br>
 poor woman was attached to these mute witnesses of her happier
life;<br>
 to her they had an almost consoling eloquence. In memory she saw
her<br>
 flowers, as in the carpets she could trace patterns hardly
visible now<br>
 to other eyes.</p>

<p>On going into the spacious anteroom, where twelve chairs, a
barometer,<br>
 a large stove, and long, white cotton curtains, bordered with
red,<br>
 suggested the dreadful waiting-room of a Government office,
the<br>
 visitor felt oppressed, conscious at once of the isolation in
which<br>
 the mistress lived. Grief, like pleasure, infects the
atmosphere. A<br>
 first glance into any home is enough to tell you whether love
or<br>
 despair reigns there.</p>

<p>Adeline would be found sitting in an immense bedroom with
beautiful<br>
 furniture by Jacob Desmalters, of mahogany finished in the
Empire<br>
 style with ormolu, which looks even less inviting than the
brass-work<br>
 of Louis XVI.! It gave one a shiver to see this lonely woman
sitting<br>
 on a Roman chair, a work-table with sphinxes before her,
colorless,<br>
 affecting false cheerfulness, but preserving her imperial air,
as she<br>
 had preserved the blue velvet gown she always wore in the house.
Her<br>
 proud spirit sustained her strength and preserved her
beauty.</p>

<p>The Baroness, by the end of her first year of banishment to
this<br>
 apartment, had gauged every depth of misfortune.</p>

<p>"Still, even here my Hector has made my life much handsomer
than it<br>
 should be for a mere peasant," said she to herself. "He chooses
that<br>
 it should be so; his will be done! I am Baroness Hulot, the
sister-in-<br>
 law of a Marshal of France. I have done nothing wrong; my two
children<br>
 are settled in life; I can wait for death, wrapped in the
spotless<br>
 veil of an immaculate wife and the crape of departed
happiness."</p>

<p>A portrait of Hulot, in the uniform of a Commissary General of
the<br>
 Imperial Guard, painted in 1810 by Robert Lefebvre, hung above
the<br>
 work-table, and when visitors were announced, Adeline threw into
a<br>
 drawer an <i>Imitation of Jesus Christ</i>, her habitual study.
This<br>
 blameless Magdalen thus heard the Voice of the Spirit in her
desert.</p>

<p>"Mariette, my child," said Lisbeth to the woman who opened the
door,<br>
 "how is my dear Adeline to-day?"</p>

<p>"Oh, she looks pretty well, mademoiselle; but between you and
me, if<br>
 she goes on in this way, she will kill herself," said Mariette
in a<br>
 whisper. "You really ought to persuade her to live better.
Now,<br>
 yesterday madame told me to give her two sous' worth of milk and
a<br>
 roll for one sou; to get her a herring for dinner and a bit of
cold<br>
 veal; she had a pound cooked to last her the week--of course,
for the<br>
 days when she dines at home and alone. She will not spend more
than<br>
 ten sous a day for her food. It is unreasonable. If I were to
say<br>
 anything about it to Monsieur le Marechal, he might quarrel
with<br>
 Monsieur le Baron and leave him nothing, whereas you, who are so
kind<br>
 and clever, can manage things----"</p>

<p>"But why do you not apply to my cousin the Baron?" said
Lisbeth.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear mademoiselle, he has not been here for three weeks
or more;<br>
 in fact, not since we last had the pleasure of seeing you!
Besides,<br>
 madame has forbidden me, under threat of dismissal, ever to ask
the<br>
 master for money. But as for grief!--oh, poor lady, she has been
very<br>
 unhappy. It is the first time that monsieur has neglected her
for so<br>
 long. Every time the bell rang she rushed to the window--but for
the<br>
 last five days she has sat still in her chair. She reads.
Whenever she<br>
 goes out to see Madame la Comtesse, she says, 'Mariette, if
monsieur<br>
 comes in,' says she, 'tell him I am at home, and send the porter
to<br>
 fetch me; he shall be well paid for his trouble.' "</p>

<p>"Poor soul!" said Lisbeth; "it goes to my heart. I speak of
her to the<br>
 Baron every day. What can I do? 'Yes,' says he, 'Betty, you are
right;<br>
 I am a wretch. My wife is an angel, and I am a monster! I will
go<br>
 to-morrow----' And he stays with Madame Marneffe. That woman
is<br>
 ruining him, and he worships her; he lives only in her sight.--I
do<br>
 what I can; if I were not there, and if I had not Mathurine to
depend<br>
 upon, he would spend twice as much as he does; and as he has
hardly<br>
 any money in the world, he would have blown his brains out by
this<br>
 time. And, I tell you, Mariette, Adeline would die of her
husband's<br>
 death, I am perfectly certain. At any rate, I pull to make both
ends<br>
 meet, and prevent my cousin from throwing too much money into
the<br>
 fire."</p>

<p>"Yes, that is what madame says, poor soul! She knows how much
she owes<br>
 you," replied Mariette. "She said she had judged you unjustly
for many<br>
 years----"</p>

<p>"Indeed!" said Lisbeth. "And did she say anything else?"</p>

<p>"No, mademoiselle. If you wish to please her, talk to her
about<br>
 Monsieur le Baron; she envies you your happiness in seeing him
every<br>
 day."</p>

<p>"Is she alone?"</p>

<p>"I beg pardon, no; the Marshal is with her. He comes every
day, and<br>
 she always tells him she saw monsieur in the morning, but that
he<br>
 comes in very late at night."</p>

<p>"And is there a good dinner to-day?"</p>

<p>Mariette hesitated; she could not meet Lisbeth's eye. The
drawing-room<br>
 door opened, and Marshal Hulot rushed out in such haste that he
bowed<br>
 to Lisbeth without looking at her, and dropped a paper. Lisbeth
picked<br>
 it up and ran after him downstairs, for it was vain to hail a
deaf<br>
 man; but she managed not to overtake the Marshal, and as she
came up<br>
 again she furtively read the following lines written in
pencil:--</p>

<p>"MY DEAR BROTHER,--My husband has given me the money for
my<br>
 quarter's expenses; but my daughter Hortense was in such need
of<br>
 it, that I lent her the whole sum, which was scarcely enough
to<br>
 set her straight. Could you lend me a few hundred francs? For
I<br>
 cannot ask Hector for more; if he were to blame me, I could
not<br>
 bear it."</p>

<p>"My word!" thought Lisbeth, "she must be in extremities to
bend her<br>
 pride to such a degree!"</p>

<p>Lisbeth went in. She saw tears in Adeline's eyes, and threw
her arms<br>
 round her neck.</p>

<p>"Adeline, my dearest, I know all," cried Cousin Betty. "Here,
the<br>
 Marshal dropped this paper--he was in such a state of mind,
and<br>
 running like a greyhound.--Has that dreadful Hector given you no
money<br>
 since----?"</p>

<p>"He gives it me quite regularly," replied the Baroness, "but
Hortense<br>
 needed it, and--"</p>

<p>"And you had not enough to pay for dinner to-night," said
Lisbeth,<br>
 interrupting her. "Now I understand why Mariette looked so
confused<br>
 when I said something about the soup. You really are
childish,<br>
 Adeline; come, take my savings."</p>

<p>"Thank you, my kind cousin," said Adeline, wiping away a tear.
"This<br>
 little difficulty is only temporary, and I have provided for
the<br>
 future. My expenses henceforth will be no more than two thousand
four<br>
 hundred francs a year, rent inclusive, and I shall have the
money.--<br>
 Above all, Betty, not a word to Hector. Is he well?"</p>

<p>"As strong as the Pont Neuf, and as gay as a lark; he thinks
of<br>
 nothing but his charmer Valerie."</p>

<p>Madame Hulot looked out at a tall silver-fir in front of the
window,<br>
 and Lisbeth could not see her cousin's eyes to read their
expression.</p>

<p>"Did you mention that it was the day when we all dine together
here?"</p>

<p>"Yes. But, dear me! Madame Marneffe is giving a grand dinner;
she<br>
 hopes to get Monsieur Coquet to resign, and that is of the
first<br>
 importance.--Now, Adeline, listen to me. You know that I am
fiercely<br>
 proud as to my independence. Your husband, my dear, will
certainly<br>
 bring you to ruin. I fancied I could be of use to you all by
living<br>
 near this woman, but she is a creature of unfathomable
depravity, and<br>
 she will make your husband promise things which will bring you
all to<br>
 disgrace." Adeline writhed like a person stabbed to the heart.
"My<br>
 dear Adeline, I am sure of what I say. I feel it is my duty
to<br>
 enlighten you.--Well, let us think of the future. The Marshal is
an<br>
 old man, but he will last a long time yet--he draws good pay;
when he<br>
 dies his widow would have a pension of six thousand francs. On
such an<br>
 income I would undertake to maintain you all. Use your influence
over<br>
 the good man to get him to marry me. It is not for the sake of
being<br>
 Madame la Marechale; I value such nonsense at no more than I
value<br>
 Madame Marneffe's conscience; but you will all have bread. I see
that<br>
 Hortense must be wanting it, since you give her yours."</p>

<p>The Marshal now came in; he had made such haste, that he was
mopping<br>
 his forehead with his bandana.</p>

<p>"I have given Mariette two thousand francs," he whispered to
his<br>
 sister-in-law.</p>

<p>Adeline colored to the roots of her hair. Two tears hung on
the<br>
 fringes of the still long lashes, and she silently pressed the
old<br>
 man's hand; his beaming face expressed the glee of a favored
lover.</p>

<p>"I intended to spend the money in a present for you, Adeline,"
said<br>
 he. "Instead of repaying me, you must choose for yourself the
thing<br>
 you would like best."</p>

<p>He took Lisbeth's hand, which she held out to him, and so
bewildered<br>
 was he by his satisfaction, that he kissed it.</p>

<p>"That looks promising," said Adeline to Lisbeth, smiling so
far as she<br>
 was able to smile.</p>

<p>The younger Hulot and his wife now came in.</p>

<p>"Is my brother coming to dinner?" asked the Marshal
sharply.</p>

<p>Adeline took up a pencil and wrote these words on a scrap of
paper:</p>

<p>"I expect him; he promised this morning that he would be here;
but if<br>
 he should not come, it would be because the Marshal kept him. He
is<br>
 overwhelmed with business."</p>

<p>And she handed him the paper. She had invented this way of
conversing<br>
 with Marshal Hulot, and kept a little collection of paper scraps
and a<br>
 pencil at hand on the work-table.</p>

<p>"I know," said the Marshal, "he is worked very hard over the
business<br>
 in Algiers."</p>

<p>At this moment, Hortense and Wenceslas arrived, and the
Baroness, as<br>
 she saw all her family about her, gave the Marshal a
significant<br>
 glance understood by none but Lisbeth.</p>

<p>Happiness had greatly improved the artist, who was adored by
his wife<br>
 and flattered by the world. His face had become almost round,
and his<br>
 graceful figure did justice to the advantages which blood gives
to men<br>
 of birth. His early fame, his important position, the
delusive<br>
 eulogies that the world sheds on artists as lightly as we say,
"How<br>
 d'ye do?" or discuss the weather, gave him that high sense of
merit<br>
 which degenerates into sheer fatuity when talent wanes. The
Cross of<br>
 the Legion of Honor was the crowning stamp of the great man
he<br>
 believed himself to be.</p>

<p>After three years of married life, Hortense was to her husband
what a<br>
 dog is to its master; she watched his every movement with a look
that<br>
 seemed a constant inquiry, her eyes were always on him, like
those of<br>
 a miser on his treasure; her admiring abnegation was quite
pathetic.<br>
 In her might be seen her mother's spirit and teaching. Her
beauty, as<br>
 great as ever, was poetically touched by the gentle shadow
of<br>
 concealed melancholy.</p>

<p>On seeing Hortense come in, it struck Lisbeth that some
long-<br>
 suppressed complaint was about to break through the thin veil
of<br>
 reticence. Lisbeth, from the first days of the honeymoon, had
been<br>
 sure that this couple had too small an income for so great a
passion.</p>

<p>Hortense, as she embraced her mother, exchanged with her a
few<br>
 whispered phrases, heart to heart, of which the mystery was
betrayed<br>
 to Lisbeth by certain shakes of the head.</p>

<p>"Adeline, like me, must work for her living," thought Cousin
Betty.<br>
 "She shall be made to tell me what she will do! Those pretty
fingers<br>
 will know at last, like mine, what it is to work because they
must."</p>

<p>At six o'clock the family party went in to dinner. A place was
laid<br>
 for Hector.</p>

<p>"Leave it so," said the Baroness to Mariette, "monsieur
sometimes<br>
 comes in late."</p>

<p>"Oh, my father will certainly come," said Victorin to his
mother. "He<br>
 promised me he would when we parted at the Chamber."</p>

<p>Lisbeth, like a spider in the middle of its net, gloated over
all<br>
 these countenances. Having known Victorin and Hortense from
their<br>
 birth, their faces were to her like panes of glass, through
which she<br>
 could read their young souls. Now, from certain stolen looks
directed<br>
 by Victorin on his mother, she saw that some disaster was
hanging over<br>
 Adeline which Victorin hesitated to reveal. The famous young
lawyer<br>
 had some covert anxiety. His deep reverence for his mother was
evident<br>
 in the regret with which he gazed at her.</p>

<p>Hortense was evidently absorbed in her own woes; for a
fortnight past,<br>
 as Lisbeth knew, she had been suffering the first uneasiness
which<br>
 want of money brings to honest souls, and to young wives on whom
life<br>
 has hitherto smiled, and who conceal their alarms. Also Lisbeth
had<br>
 immediately guessed that her mother had given her no money.
Adeline's<br>
 delicacy had brought her so low as to use the fallacious excuses
that<br>
 necessity suggests to borrowers.</p>

<p>Hortense's absence of mind, with her brother's and the
Baroness' deep<br>
 dejection, made the dinner a melancholy meal, especially with
the<br>
 added chill of the Marshal's utter deafness. Three persons gave
a<br>
 little life to the scene: Lisbeth, Celestine, and Wenceslas.<br>
 Hortense's affection had developed the artist's natural
liveliness as<br>
 a Pole, the somewhat swaggering vivacity and noisy high spirits
that<br>
 characterize these Frenchmen of the North. His frame of mind and
the<br>
 expression of his face showed plainly that he believed in
himself, and<br>
 that poor Hortense, faithful to her mother's training, kept
all<br>
 domestic difficulties to herself.</p>

<p>"You must be content, at any rate," said Lisbeth to her young
cousin,<br>
 as they rose from table, "since your mother has helped you with
her<br>
 money."</p>

<p>"Mamma!" replied Hortense in astonishment. "Oh, poor mamma! It
is for<br>
 me that she would like to make money. You do not know, Lisbeth,
but I<br>
 have a horrible suspicion that she works for it in secret."</p>

<p>They were crossing the large, dark drawing-room where there
were no<br>
 candles, all following Mariette, who was carrying the lamp
into<br>
 Adeline's bedroom. At this instant Victorin just touched Lisbeth
and<br>
 Hortense on the arm. The two women, understanding the hint,
left<br>
 Wenceslas, Celestine, the Marshal, and the Baroness to go on
together,<br>
 and remained standing in a window-bay.</p>

<p>"What is it, Victorin?" said Lisbeth. "Some disaster caused by
your<br>
 father, I dare wager."</p>

<p>"Yes, alas!" replied Victorin. "A money-lender named Vauvinet
has<br>
 bills of my father's to the amount of sixty thousand francs, and
wants<br>
 to prosecute. I tried to speak of the matter to my father at
the<br>
 Chamber, but he would not understand me; he almost avoided me.
Had we<br>
 better tell my mother?"</p>

<p>"No, no," said Lisbeth, "she has too many troubles; it would
be a<br>
 death-blow; you must spare her. You have no idea how low she
has<br>
 fallen. But for your uncle, you would have found no dinner here
this<br>
 evening."</p>

<p>"Dear Heaven! Victorin, what wretches we are!" said Hortense
to her<br>
 brother. "We ought to have guessed what Lisbeth has told us. My
dinner<br>
 is choking me!"</p>

<p>Hortense could say no more; she covered her mouth with her<br>
 handkerchief to smother a sob, and melted into tears.</p>

<p>"I told the fellow Vauvinet to call on me to-morrow,"
replied<br>
 Victorin, "but will he be satisfied by my guarantee on a
mortgage? I<br>
 doubt it. Those men insist on ready money to sweat others on
usurious<br>
 terms."</p>

<p>"Let us sell out of the funds!" said Lisbeth to Hortense.</p>

<p>"What good would that do?" replied Victorin. "It would bring
fifteen<br>
 or sixteen thousand francs, and we want sixty thousand."</p>

<p>"Dear cousin!" cried Hortense, embracing Lisbeth with the
enthusiasm<br>
 of guilelessness.</p>

<p>"No, Lisbeth, keep your little fortune," said Victorin,
pressing the<br>
 old maid's hand. "I shall see to-morrow what this man would be
up to.<br>
 With my wife's consent, I can at least hinder or postpone
the<br>
 prosecution--for it would really be frightful to see my father's
honor<br>
 impugned. What would the War Minister say? My father's salary,
which<br>
 he pledged for three years, will not be released before the
month of<br>
 December, so we cannot offer that as a guarantee. This Vauvinet
has<br>
 renewed the bills eleven times; so you may imagine what my
father must<br>
 pay in interest. We must close this pit."</p>

<p><br>
 "If only Madame Marneffe would throw him over!" said
Hortense<br>
 bitterly.</p>

<p>"Heaven forbid!" exclaimed Victorin. "He would take up some
one else;<br>
 and with her, at any rate, the worst outlay is over."</p>

<p>What a change in children formerly so respectful, and kept so
long by<br>
 their mother in blind worship of their father! They knew him now
for<br>
 what he was.</p>

<p>"But for me," said Lisbeth, "your father's ruin would be more
complete<br>
 than it is."</p>

<p>"Come in to mamma," said Hortense; "she is very sharp, and
will<br>
 suspect something; as our kind Lisbeth says, let us keep
everything<br>
 from her--let us be cheerful."</p>

<p>"Victorin," said Lisbeth, "you have no notion of what your
father will<br>
 be brought to by his passion for women. Try to secure some
future<br>
 resource by getting the Marshal to marry me. Say something about
it<br>
 this evening; I will leave early on purpose."</p>

<p>Victorin went into the bedroom.</p>

<p>"And you, poor little thing!" said Lisbeth in an undertone
to<br>
 Hortense, "what can you do?"</p>

<p>"Come to dinner with us to-morrow, and we will talk it over,"
answered<br>
 Hortense. "I do not know which way to turn; you know how hard
life is,<br>
 and you will advise me."</p>

<p>While the whole family with one consent tried to persuade the
Marshal<br>
 to marry, and while Lisbeth was making her way home to the
Rue<br>
 Vanneau, one of those incidents occurred which, in such women
as<br>
 Madame Marneffe, are a stimulus to vice by compelling them to
exert<br>
 their energy and every resource of depravity. One fact, at any
rate,<br>
 must however be acknowledged: life in Paris is too full for
vicious<br>
 persons to do wrong instinctively and unprovoked; vice is only
a<br>
 weapon of defence against aggressors--that is all.</p>

<p>Madame Marneffe's drawing-room was full of her faithful
admirers, and<br>
 she had just started the whist-tables, when the footman, a
pensioned<br>
 soldier recruited by the Baron, announced:</p>

<p>"Monsieur le Baron Montes de Montejanos."</p>

<p>Valerie's heart jumped, but she hurried to the door,
exclaiming:</p>

<p>"My cousin!" and as she met the Brazilian, she whispered:</p>

<p>"You are my relation--or all is at an end between us!--And so
you were<br>
 not wrecked, Henri?" she went on audibly, as she led him to the
fire.<br>
 "I heard you were lost, and have mourned for you these three
years."</p>

<p>"How are you, my good fellow?" said Marneffe, offering his
hand to the<br>
 stranger, whose get-up was indeed that of a Brazilian and a<br>
 millionaire.</p>

<p>Monsieur le Baron Henri Montes de Montejanos, to whom the
climate of<br>
 the equator had given the color and stature we expect to see
in<br>
 Othello on the stage, had an alarming look of gloom, but it was
a<br>
 merely pictorial illusion; for, sweet and affectionate by
nature, he<br>
 was predestined to be the victim that a strong man often is to a
weak<br>
 woman. The scorn expressed in his countenance, the muscular
strength<br>
 of his stalwart frame, all his physical powers were shown only
to his<br>
 fellow-men; a form of flattery which women appreciate, nay,
which so<br>
 intoxicates them, that every man with his mistress on his arm
assumes<br>
 a matador swagger that provokes a smile. Very well set up, in
a<br>
 closely fitting blue coat with solid gold buttons, in black
trousers,<br>
 spotless patent evening boots, and gloves of a fashionable hue,
the<br>
 only Brazilian touch in the Baron's costume was a large diamond,
worth<br>
 about a hundred thousand francs, which blazed like a star on
a<br>
 handsome blue silk cravat, tucked into a white waistcoat in such
a way<br>
 as to show corners of a fabulously fine shirt front.</p>

<p>His brow, bossy like that of a satyr, a sign of tenacity in
his<br>
 passions, was crowned by thick jet-black hair like a virgin
forest,<br>
 and under it flashed a pair of hazel eyes, so wild looking as
to<br>
 suggest that before his birth his mother must have been scared
by a<br>
 jaguar.</p>

<p>This fine specimen of the Portuguese race in Brazil took his
stand<br>
 with his back to the fire, in an attitude that showed
familiarity with<br>
 Paris manners; holding his hat in one hand, his elbow resting on
the<br>
 velvet-covered shelf, he bent over Madame Marneffe, talking to
her in<br>
 an undertone, and troubling himself very little about the
dreadful<br>
 people who, in his opinion, were so very much in the way.</p>

<p>This fashion of taking the stage, with the Brazilian's
attitude and<br>
 expression, gave, alike to Crevel and to the baron, an identical
shock<br>
 of curiosity and anxiety. Both were struck by the same
impression and<br>
 the same surmise. And the manoeuvre suggested in each by their
very<br>
 genuine passion was so comical in its simultaneous results, that
it<br>
 made everybody smile who was sharp enough to read its meaning.
Crevel,<br>
 a tradesman and shopkeeper to the backbone, though a mayor of
Paris,<br>
 unluckily, was a little slower to move than his rival partner,
and<br>
 this enabled the Baron to read at a glance Crevel's involuntary
self-<br>
 betrayal. This was a fresh arrow to rankle in the very amorous
old<br>
 man's heart, and he resolved to have an explanation from
Valerie.</p>

<p>"This evening," said Crevel to himself too, as he sorted his
hand, "I<br>
 must know where I stand."</p>

<p>"You have a heart!" cried Marneffe. "You have just
revoked."</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon," said Crevel, trying to withdraw his
card.--"This<br>
 Baron seems to me very much in the way," he went on, thinking
to<br>
 himself. "If Valerie carries on with my Baron, well and good--it
is a<br>
 means to my revenge, and I can get rid of him if I choose; but
as for<br>
 this cousin!--He is one Baron too many; I do not mean to be made
a<br>
 fool of. I will know how they are related."</p>

<p>That evening, by one of those strokes of luck which come to
pretty<br>
 women, Valerie was charmingly dressed. Her white bosom gleamed
under a<br>
 lace tucker of rusty white, which showed off the satin texture
of her<br>
 beautiful shoulders--for Parisian women, Heaven knows how, have
some<br>
 way of preserving their fine flesh and remaining slender. She
wore a<br>
 black velvet gown that looked as if it might at any moment slip
off<br>
 her shoulders, and her hair was dressed with lace and
drooping<br>
 flowers. Her arms, not fat but dimpled, were graced by deep
ruffles to<br>
 her sleeves. She was like a luscious fruit coquettishly served
in a<br>
 handsome dish, and making the knife-blade long to be cutting
it.</p>

<p>"Valerie," the Brazilian was saying in her ear, "I have come
back<br>
 faithful to you. My uncle is dead; I am twice as rich as I was
when I<br>
 went away. I mean to live and die in Paris, for you and with
you."</p>

<p>"Lower, Henri, I implore you----"</p>

<p>"Pooh! I mean to speak to you this evening, even if I should
have to<br>
 pitch all these creatures out of window, especially as I have
lost two<br>
 days in looking for you. I shall stay till the last.--I can,
I<br>
 suppose?"</p>

<p>Valerie smiled at her adopted cousin, and said:</p>

<p>"Remember that you are the son of my mother's sister, who
married your<br>
 father during Junot's campaign in Portugal."</p>

<p>"What, I, Montes de Montejanos, great grandson of a conquerer
of<br>
 Brazil! Tell a lie?"</p>

<p>"Hush, lower, or we shall never meet again."</p>

<p>"Pray, why?"</p>

<p>"Marneffe, like all dying wretches, who always take up some
last whim,<br>
 has a revived passion for me----"</p>

<p>"That cur?" said the Brazilian, who knew his Marneffe; "I will
settle<br>
 him!"</p>

<p>"What violence!"</p>

<p>"And where did you get all this splendor?" the Brazilian went
on, just<br>
 struck by the magnificence of the apartment.</p>

<p>She began to laugh.</p>

<p>"Henri! what bad taste!" said she.</p>

<p>She had felt two burning flashes of jealousy which had moved
her so<br>
 far as to make her look at the two souls in purgatory. Crevel,
playing<br>
 against Baron Hulot and Monsieur Coquet, had Marneffe for his
partner.<br>
 The game was even, because Crevel and the Baron were equally
absent-<br>
 minded, and made blunder after blunder. Thus, in one instant,
the old<br>
 men both confessed the passion which Valerie had persuaded them
to<br>
 keep secret for the past three years; but she too had failed to
hide<br>
 the joy in her eyes at seeing the man who had first taught her
heart<br>
 to beat, the object of her first love. The rights of such
happy<br>
 mortals survive as long as the woman lives over whom they
have<br>
 acquired them.</p>

<p>With these three passions at her side--one supported by the
insolence<br>
 of wealth, the second by the claims of possession, and the third
by<br>
 youth, strength, fortune, and priority--Madame Marneffe
preserved her<br>
 coolness and presence of mind, like General Bonaparte when, at
the<br>
 siege of Mantua, he had to fight two armies, and at the same
time<br>
 maintain the blockade.</p>

<p>Jealousy, distorting Hulot's face, made him look as terrible
as the<br>
 late Marshal Montcornet leading a cavalry charge against a
Russian<br>
 square. Being such a handsome man, he had never known any ground
for<br>
 jealousy, any more than Murat knew what it was to be afraid. He
had<br>
 always felt sure that he should triumph. His rebuff by Josepha,
the<br>
 first he had ever met, he ascribed to her love of money; "he
was<br>
 conquered by millions, and not by a changeling," he would say
when<br>
 speaking of the Duc d'Herouville. And now, in one instant, the
poison<br>
 and delirium that the mad passion sheds in a flood had rushed to
his<br>
 heart. He kept turning from the whist-table towards the
fireplace with<br>
 an action <i>a la</i> Mirabeau; and as he laid down his cards to
cast a<br>
 challenging glance at the Brazilian and Valerie, the rest of
the<br>
 company felt the sort of alarm mingled with curiosity that is
caused<br>
 by evident violence ready to break out at any moment. The sham
cousin<br>
 stared at Hulot as he might have looked at some big China
mandarin.</p>

<p>This state of things could not last; it was bound to end in
some<br>
 tremendous outbreak. Marneffe was as much afraid of Hulot as
Crevel<br>
 was of Marneffe, for he was anxious not to die a mere clerk.
Men<br>
 marked for death believe in life as galley-slaves believe in
liberty;<br>
 this man was bent on being a first-class clerk at any cost.
Thoroughly<br>
 frightened by the pantomime of the Baron and Crevel, he rose,
said a<br>
 few words in his wife's ear, and then, to the surprise of all,
Valerie<br>
 went into the adjoining bedroom with the Brazilian and her
husband.</p>

<p>"Did Madame Marneffe ever speak to you of this cousin of
hers?" said<br>
 Crevel to Hulot.</p>

<p>"Never!" replied the Baron, getting up. "That is enough for
this<br>
 evening," said he. "I have lost two louis--there they are."</p>

<p>He threw the two gold pieces on the table, and seated himself
on the<br>
 sofa with a look which everybody else took as a hint to go.
Monsieur<br>
 and Madame Coquet, after exchanging a few words, left the room,
and<br>
 Claude Vignon, in despair, followed their example. These two<br>
 departures were a hint to less intelligent persons, who now
found that<br>
 they were not wanted. The Baron and Crevel were left together,
and<br>
 spoke never a word. Hulot, at last, ignoring Crevel, went on
tiptoe to<br>
 listen at the bedroom door; but he bounded back with a
prodigious<br>
 jump, for Marneffe opened the door and appeared with a calm
face,<br>
 astonished to find only the two men.</p>

<p>"And the tea?" said he.</p>

<p>"Where is Valerie?" replied the Baron in a rage.</p>

<p>"My wife," said Marneffe. "She is gone upstairs to speak
to<br>
 mademoiselle your cousin. She will come down directly."</p>

<p>"And why has she deserted us for that stupid creature?"</p>

<p>"Well," said Marneffe, "Mademoiselle Lisbeth came back from
dining<br>
 with the Baroness with an attack of indigestion and Mathurine
asked<br>
 Valerie for some tea for her, so my wife went up to see what was
the<br>
 matter."</p>

<p>"And <i>her</i> cousin?"</p>

<p>"He is gone."</p>

<p>"Do you really believe that?" said the Baron.</p>

<p>"I have seen him to his carriage," replied Marneffe, with a
hideous<br>
 smirk.</p>

<p>The wheels of a departing carriage were audible in the street.
The<br>
 Baron, counting Marneffe for nothing, went upstairs to Lisbeth.
An<br>
 idea flashed through him such as the heart sends to the brain
when it<br>
 is on fire with jealousy. Marneffe's baseness was so well known
to<br>
 him, that he could imagine the most degrading connivance
between<br>
 husband and wife.</p>

<p>"What has become of all the ladies and gentlemen?" said
Marneffe,<br>
 finding himself alone with Crevel.</p>

<p>"When the sun goes to bed, the cocks and hens follow suit,"
said<br>
 Crevel. "Madame Marneffe disappeared, and her adorers departed.
Will<br>
 you play a game of piquet?" added Crevel, who meant to
remain.</p>

<p>He too believed that the Brazilian was in the house.</p>

<p>Monsieur Marneffe agreed. The Mayor was a match for the Baron.
Simply<br>
 by playing cards with the husband he could stay on indefinitely;
and<br>
 Marneffe, since the suppression of the public tables, was
quite<br>
 satisfied with the more limited opportunities of private
play.</p>

<p>Baron Hulot went quickly up to Lisbeth's apartment, but the
door was<br>
 locked, and the usual inquiries through the door took up time
enough<br>
 to enable the two light-handed and cunning women to arrange the
scene<br>
 of an attack of indigestion with the accessories of tea. Lisbeth
was<br>
 in such pain that Valerie was very much alarmed, and
consequently<br>
 hardly paid any heed to the Baron's furious entrance.
Indisposition is<br>
 one of the screens most often placed by women to ward off a
quarrel.<br>
 Hulot peeped about, here and there, but could see no spot in
Cousin<br>
 Betty's room where a Brazilian might lie hidden.</p>

<p><br>
 "Your indigestion does honor to my wife's dinner, Lisbeth," said
he,<br>
 scrutinizing her, for Lisbeth was perfectly well, trying to
imitate<br>
 the hiccough of spasmodic indigestion as she drank her tea.</p>

<p>"How lucky it is that dear Betty should be living under my
roof!" said<br>
 Madame Marneffe. "But for me, the poor thing would have
died."</p>

<p>"You look as if you only half believed it," added Lisbeth,
turning to<br>
 the Baron, "and that would be a shame----"</p>

<p>"Why?" asked the Baron. "Do you know the purpose of my
visit?"</p>

<p>And he leered at the door of a dressing-closet from which the
key had<br>
 been withdrawn.</p>

<p>"Are you talking Greek?" said Madame Marneffe, with an
appealing look<br>
 of misprized tenderness and devotedness.</p>

<p>"But it is all through you, my dear cousin; yes, it is your
doing that<br>
 I am in such a state," said Lisbeth vehemently.</p>

<p>This speech diverted the Baron's attention; he looked at the
old maid<br>
 with the greatest astonishment.</p>

<p>"You know that I am devoted to you," said Lisbeth. "I am here,
that<br>
 says everything. I am wearing out the last shreds of my strength
in<br>
 watching over your interests, since they are one with our
dear<br>
 Valerie's. Her house costs one-tenth of what any other does that
is<br>
 kept on the same scale. But for me, Cousin, instead of two
thousand<br>
 francs a month, you would be obliged to spend three or four
thousand."</p>

<p>"I know all that," replied the Baron out of patience; "you are
our<br>
 protectress in many ways," he added, turning to Madame Marneffe
and<br>
 putting his arm round her neck.--"Is not she, my pretty
sweet?"</p>

<p>"On my honor," exclaimed Valerie, "I believe you are gone
mad!"</p>

<p>"Well, you cannot doubt my attachment," said Lisbeth. "But I
am also<br>
 very fond of my cousin Adeline, and I found her in tears. She
has not<br>
 seen you for a month. Now that is really too bad; you leave my
poor<br>
 Adeline without a sou. Your daughter Hortense almost died of it
when<br>
 she was told that it is thanks to your brother that we had any
dinner<br>
 at all. There was not even bread in your house this day.</p>

<p>"Adeline is heroically resolved to keep her sufferings to
herself. She<br>
 said to me, 'I will do as you have done!' The speech went to my
heart;<br>
 and after dinner, as I thought of what my cousin had been in
1811, and<br>
 of what she is in 1841--thirty years after--I had a violent<br>
 indigestion.--I fancied I should get over it; but when I got
home, I<br>
 thought I was dying--"</p>

<p>"You see, Valerie, to what my adoration of you has brought me!
To<br>
 crime--domestic crime!"</p>

<p>"Oh! I was wise never to marry!" cried Lisbeth, with savage
joy. "You<br>
 are a kind, good man; Adeline is a perfect angel;--and this is
the<br>
 reward of her blind devotion."</p>

<p>"An elderly angel!" said Madame Marneffe softly, as she looked
half<br>
 tenderly, half mockingly, at her Hector, who was gazing at her
as an<br>
 examining judge gazes at the accused.</p>

<p>"My poor wife!" said Hulot. "For more than nine months I have
given<br>
 her no money, though I find it for you, Valerie; but at what a
cost!<br>
 No one else will ever love you so, and what torments you inflict
on me<br>
 in return!"</p>

<p>"Torments?" she echoed. "Then what do you call happiness?"</p>

<p>"I do not yet know on what terms you have been with this
so-called<br>
 cousin whom you never mentioned to me," said the Baron, paying
no heed<br>
 to Valerie's interjection. "But when he came in I felt as if
a<br>
 penknife had been stuck into my heart. Blinded I may be, but I
am not<br>
 blind. I could read his eyes, and yours. In short, from under
that<br>
 ape's eyelids there flashed sparks that he flung at you--and
your<br>
 eyes!--Oh! you have never looked at me so, never! As to this
mystery,<br>
 Valerie, it shall all be cleared up. You are the only woman who
ever<br>
 made me know the meaning of jealousy, so you need not be
surprised by<br>
 what I say.--But another mystery which has rent its cloud, and
it<br>
 seems to me infamous----"</p>

<p>"Go on, go on," said Valerie.</p>

<p>"It is that Crevel, that square lump of flesh and stupidity,
is in<br>
 love with you, and that you accept his attentions with so good a
grace<br>
 that the idiot flaunts his passion before everybody."</p>

<p>"Only three! Can you discover no more?" asked Madame
Marneffe.</p>

<p>"There may be more!" retorted the Baron.</p>

<p>"If Monsieur Crevel is in love with me, he is in his rights as
a man<br>
 after all; if I favored his passion, that would indeed be the
act of a<br>
 coquette, or of a woman who would leave much to be desired on
your<br>
 part.--Well, love me as you find me, or let me alone. If you
restore<br>
 me to freedom, neither you nor Monsieur Crevel will ever enter
my<br>
 doors again. But I will take up with my cousin, just to keep my
hand<br>
 in, in those charming habits you suppose me to
indulge.--Good-bye,<br>
 Monsieur le Baron Hulot."</p>

<p>She rose, but the Baron took her by the arm and made her sit
down<br>
 again. The old man could not do without Valerie. She had become
more<br>
 imperatively indispensable to him than the necessaries of life;
he<br>
 preferred remaining in uncertainty to having any proof of
Valerie's<br>
 infidelity.</p>

<p>"My dearest Valerie," said he, "do you not see how miserable I
am? I<br>
 only ask you to justify yourself. Give me sufficient
reasons--"</p>

<p>"Well, go downstairs and wait for me; for I suppose you do not
wish to<br>
 look on at the various ceremonies required by your cousin's
state."</p>

<p>Hulot slowly turned away</p>

<p>"You old profligate," cried Lisbeth, "you have not even asked
me how<br>
 your children are? What are you going to do for Adeline? I, at
any<br>
 rate, will take her my savings to-morrow."</p>

<p>"You owe your wife white bread to eat at least," said Madame
Marneffe,<br>
 smiling.</p>

<p>The Baron, without taking offence at Lisbeth's tone, as
despotic as<br>
 Josepha's, got out of the room, only too glad to escape so
importunate<br>
 a question.</p>

<p>The door bolted once more, the Brazilian came out of the
dressing-<br>
 closet, where he had been waiting, and he appeared with his eyes
full<br>
 of tears, in a really pitiable condition. Montes had heard
everything.</p>

<p>"Henri, you must have ceased to love me, I know it!" said
Madame<br>
 Marneffe, hiding her face in her handkerchief and bursting into
tears.</p>

<p>It was the outcry of real affection. The cry of a woman's
despair is<br>
 so convincing that it wins the forgiveness that lurks at the
bottom of<br>
 every lover's heart--when she is young and pretty, and wears a
gown so<br>
 low that she could slip out at the top and stand in the garb of
Eve.</p>

<p>"But why, if you love me, do you not leave everything for my
sake?"<br>
 asked the Brazilian.</p>

<p>This South American born, being logical, as men are who have
lived the<br>
 life of nature, at once resumed the conversation at the point
where it<br>
 had been broken off, putting his arm round Valerie's waist.</p>

<p>"Why?" she repeated, gazing up at Henri, whom she subjugated
at once<br>
 by a look charged with passion, "why, my dear boy, I am married;
we<br>
 are in Paris, not in the savannah, the pampas, the backwoods
of<br>
 America.--My dear Henri, my first and only love, listen to me.
That<br>
 husband of mine, a second clerk in the War Office, is bent on
being a<br>
 head-clerk and officer of the Legion of Honor; can I help his
being<br>
 ambitious? Now for the very reason that made him leave us our
liberty<br>
 --nearly four years ago, do you remember, you bad boy?--he
now<br>
 abandons me to Monsieur Hulot. I cannot get rid of that
dreadful<br>
 official, who snorts like a grampus, who has fins in his
nostrils, who<br>
 is sixty-three years old, and who had grown ten years older by
dint of<br>
 trying to be young; who is so odious to me that the very day
when<br>
 Marneffe is promoted, and gets his Cross of the Legion of
Honor----"</p>

<p>"How much more will your husband get then?"</p>

<p>"A thousand crowns."</p>

<p>"I will pay him as much in an annuity," said Baron Montes. "We
will<br>
 leave Paris and go----"</p>

<p>"Where?" said Valerie, with one of the pretty sneers by which
a woman<br>
 makes fun of a man she is sure of. "Paris is the only place
where we<br>
 can live happy. I care too much for your love to risk seeing it
die<br>
 out in a <i>tete-a-tete</i> in the wilderness. Listen, Henri,
you are the<br>
 only man I care for in the whole world. Write that down clearly
in<br>
 your tiger's brain."</p>

<p>For women, when they have made a sheep of a man, always tell
him that<br>
 he is a lion with a will of iron.</p>

<p>"Now, attend to me. Monsieur Marneffe has not five years to
live; he<br>
 is rotten to the marrow of his bones. He spends seven months of
the<br>
 twelve in swallowing drugs and decoctions; he lives wrapped
in<br>
 flannel; in short, as the doctor says, he lives under the
scythe, and<br>
 may be cut off at any moment. An illness that would not harm
another<br>
 man would be fatal to him; his blood is corrupt, his life
undermined<br>
 at the root. For five years I have never allowed him to kiss
me--he is<br>
 poisonous! Some day, and the day is not far off, I shall be a
widow.<br>
 Well, then, I--who have already had an offer from a man with
sixty<br>
 thousand francs a year, I who am as completely mistress of that
man as<br>
 I am of this lump of sugar--I swear to you that if you were as
poor as<br>
 Hulot and as foul as Marneffe, if you beat me even, still you
are the<br>
 only man I will have for a husband, the only man I love, or
whose name<br>
 I will ever bear. And I am ready to give any pledge of my love
that<br>
 you may require."</p>

<p>"Well, then, to-night----"</p>

<p>"But you, son of the South, my splendid jaguar, come expressly
for me<br>
 from the virgin forest of Brazil," said she, taking his hand
and<br>
 kissing and fondling it, "I have some consideration for the
poor<br>
 creature you mean to make your wife.--Shall I be your wife,
Henri?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said the Brazilian, overpowered by this unbridled
volubility of<br>
 passion. And he knelt at her feet.</p>

<p>"Well, then, Henri," said Valerie, taking his two hands and
looking<br>
 straight into his eyes, "swear to me now, in the presence of
Lisbeth,<br>
 my best and only friend, my sister--that you will make me your
wife at<br>
 the end of my year's widowhood."</p>

<p>"I swear it."</p>

<p>"That is not enough. Swear by your mother's ashes and
eternal<br>
 salvation, swear by the Virgin Mary and by all your hopes as
a<br>
 Catholic!"</p>

<p>Valerie knew that the Brazilian would keep that oath even if
she<br>
 should have fallen into the foulest social slough.</p>

<p>The Baron solemnly swore it, his nose almost touching
Valerie's white<br>
 bosom, and his eyes spellbound. He was drunk, drunk as a man is
when<br>
 he sees the woman he loves once more, after a sea voyage of a
hundred<br>
 and twenty days.</p>

<p>"Good. Now be quite easy. And in Madame Marneffe respect the
future<br>
 Baroness de Montejanos. You are not to spend a sou upon me; I
forbid<br>
 it.--Stay here in the outer room; sleep on the sofa. I myself
will<br>
 come and tell you when you may move.--We will breakfast
to-morrow<br>
 morning, and you can be leaving at about one o'clock as if you
had<br>
 come to call at noon. There is nothing to fear; the gate-keepers
love<br>
 me as much as if they were my father and mother.--Now I must go
down<br>
 and make tea."</p>

<p>She beckoned to Lisbeth, who followed her out on to the
landing. There<br>
 Valerie whispered in the old maid's ear:</p>

<p>"My darkie has come back too soon. I shall die if I cannot
avenge you<br>
 on Hortense!"</p>

<p>"Make your mind easy, my pretty little devil!" said Lisbeth,
kissing<br>
 her forehead. "Love and Revenge on the same track will never
lose the<br>
 game. Hortense expects me to-morrow; she is in beggary. For a
thousand<br>
 francs you may have a thousand kisses from Wenceslas."</p>

<p>On leaving Valerie, Hulot had gone down to the porter's lodge
and made<br>
 a sudden invasion there.</p>

<p>"Madame Olivier?"</p>

<p>On hearing the imperious tone of this address, and seeing the
action<br>
 by which the Baron emphasized it, Madame Olivier came out into
the<br>
 courtyard as far as the Baron led her.</p>

<p>"You know that if any one can help your son to a connection by
and by,<br>
 it is I; it is owing to me that he is already third clerk in
a<br>
 notary's office, and is finishing his studies."</p>

<p>"Yes, Monsieur le Baron; and indeed, sir, you may depend on
our<br>
 gratitude. Not a day passes that I do not pray to God for
Monsieur le<br>
 Baron's happiness."</p>

<p>"Not so many words, my good woman," said Hulot, "but
deeds----"</p>

<p>"What can I do, sir?" asked Madame Olivier.</p>

<p>"A man came here to-night in a carriage. Do you know him?"</p>

<p>Madame Olivier had recognized Montes well enough. How could
she have<br>
 forgotten him? In the Rue du Doyenne the Brazilian had always
slipped<br>
 a five-franc piece into her hand as he went out in the morning,
rather<br>
 too early. If the Baron had applied to Monsieur Olivier, he
would<br>
 perhaps have learned all he wanted to know. But Olivier was in
bed. In<br>
 the lower orders the woman is not merely the superior of the
man--she<br>
 almost always has the upper hand. Madame Olivier had long since
made<br>
 up her mind as to which side to take in case of a collision
between<br>
 her two benefactors; she regarded Madame Marneffe as the
stronger<br>
 power.</p>

<p>"Do I know him?" she repeated. "No, indeed, no. I never saw
him<br>
 before!"</p>

<p>"What! Did Madame Marneffe's cousin never go to see her when
she was<br>
 living in the Rue du Doyenne?"</p>

<p>"Oh! Was it her cousin?" cried Madame Olivier. "I dare say he
did<br>
 come, but I did not know him again. Next time, sir, I will look
at<br>
 him----"</p>

<p>"He will be coming out," said Hulot, hastily interrupting
Madame<br>
 Olivier.</p>

<p>"He has left," said Madame Olivier, understanding the
situation. "The<br>
 carriage is gone."</p>

<p>"Did you see him go?"</p>

<p>"As plainly as I see you. He told his servant to drive to
the<br>
 Embassy."</p>

<p>This audacious statement wrung a sigh of relief from the
Baron; he<br>
 took Madame Olivier's hand and squeezed it.</p>

<p>"Thank you, my good Madame Olivier. But that is not
all.--Monsieur<br>
 Crevel?"</p>

<p>"Monsieur Crevel? What can you mean, sir? I do not
understand," said<br>
 Madame Olivier.</p>

<p>"Listen to me. He is Madame Marneffe's lover----"</p>

<p>"Impossible, Monsieur le Baron; impossible," said she,
clasping her<br>
 hands.</p>

<p>"He is Madame Marneffe's lover," the Baron repeated very
positively.<br>
 "How do they manage it? I don't know; but I mean to know, and
you are<br>
 to find out. If you can put me on the tracks of this intrigue,
your<br>
 son is a notary."</p>

<p>"Don't you fret yourself so, Monsieur le Baron," said Madame
Olivier.<br>
 "Madame cares for you, and for no one but you; her maid knows
that for<br>
 true, and we say, between her and me, that you are the luckiest
man in<br>
 this world--for you know what madame is.--Just perfection!</p>

<p>"She gets up at ten every morning; then she breakfasts. Well
and good.<br>
 After that she takes an hour or so to dress; that carries her on
till<br>
 two; then she goes for a walk in the Tuileries in the sight of
all<br>
 men, and she is always in by four to be ready for you. She lives
like<br>
 clockwork. She keeps no secrets from her maid, and Reine keeps
nothing<br>
 from me, you may be sure. Reine can't if she would--along of my
son,<br>
 for she is very sweet upon him. So, you see, if madame had
any<br>
 intimacy with Monsieur Crevel, we should be bound to know
it."</p>

<p>The Baron went upstairs again with a beaming countenance,
convinced<br>
 that he was the only man in the world to that shameless slut,
as<br>
 treacherous, but as lovely and as engaging as a siren.</p>

<p>Crevel and Marneffe had begun a second rubber at piquet.
Crevel was<br>
 losing, as a man must who is not giving his thoughts to his
game.<br>
 Marneffe, who knew the cause of the Mayor's absence of mind,
took<br>
 unscrupulous advantage of it; he looked at the cards in reverse,
and<br>
 discarded accordingly; thus, knowing his adversary's hand, he
played<br>
 to beat him. The stake being a franc a point, he had already
robbed<br>
 the Mayor of thirty francs when Hulot came in.</p>

<p>"Hey day!" said he, amazed to find no company. "Are you alone?
Where<br>
 is everybody gone?"</p>

<p>"Your pleasant temper put them all to flight," said
Crevel.</p>

<p>"No, it was my wife's cousin," replied Marneffe. "The ladies
and<br>
 gentlemen supposed that Valerie and Henri might have something
to say<br>
 to each other after three years' separation, and they very
discreetly<br>
 retired.--If I had been in the room, I would have kept them; but
then,<br>
 as it happens, it would have been a mistake, for Lisbeth, who
always<br>
 comes down to make tea at half-past ten, was taken ill, and that
upset<br>
 everything--"</p>

<p>"Then is Lisbeth really unwell?" asked Crevel in a fury.</p>

<p>"So I was told," replied Marneffe, with the heartless
indifference of<br>
 a man to whom women have ceased to exist.</p>

<p>The Mayor looked at the clock; and, calculating the time, the
Baron<br>
 seemed to have spent forty minutes in Lisbeth's rooms.
Hector's<br>
 jubilant expression seriously incriminated Valerie, Lisbeth,
and<br>
 himself.</p>

<p>"I have just seen her; she is in great pain, poor soul!" said
the<br>
 Baron.</p>

<p>"Then the sufferings of others must afford you much joy, my
friend,"<br>
 retorted Crevel with acrimony, "for you have come down with a
face<br>
 that is positively beaming. Is Lisbeth likely to die? For
your<br>
 daughter, they say, is her heiress. You are not like the same
man. You<br>
 left this room looking like the Moor of Venice, and you come
back with<br>
 the air of Saint-Preux!--I wish I could see Madame Marneffe's
face at<br>
 this minute----"</p>

<p>"And pray, what do you mean by that?" said Marneffe to Crevel,
packing<br>
 his cards and laying them down in front of him.</p>

<p>A light kindled in the eyes of this man, decrepit at the age
of forty-<br>
 seven; a faint color flushed his flaccid cold cheeks, his
ill-<br>
 furnished mouth was half open, and on his blackened lips a sort
of<br>
 foam gathered, thick, and as white as chalk. This fury in such
a<br>
 helpless wretch, whose life hung on a thread, and who in a duel
would<br>
 risk nothing while Crevel had everything to lose, frightened
the<br>
 Mayor.</p>

<p>"I said," repeated Crevel, "that I should like to see
Madame<br>
 Marneffe's face. And with all the more reason since yours, at
this<br>
 moment, is most unpleasant. On my honor, you are horribly ugly,
my<br>
 dear Marneffe----"</p>

<p>"Do you know that you are very uncivil?"</p>

<p>"A man who has won thirty francs of me in forty-five minutes
cannot<br>
 look handsome in my eyes."</p>

<p>"Ah, if you had but seen me seventeen years ago!" replied the
clerk.</p>

<p>"You were so good-looking?" asked Crevel.</p>

<p>"That was my ruin; now, if I had been like you--I might be a
mayor and<br>
 a peer."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Crevel, with a smile, "you have been too much in
the wars;<br>
 and of the two forms of metal that may be earned by worshiping
the god<br>
 of trade, you have taken the worse--the dross!" [This dialogue
is<br>
 garnished with puns for which it is difficult to find any
English<br>
 equivalent.] And Crevel roared with laughter. Though Marneffe
could<br>
 take offence if his honor were in peril, he always took these
rough<br>
 pleasantries in good part; they were the small coin of
conversation<br>
 between him and Crevel.</p>

<p>"The daughters of Eve cost me dear, no doubt; but, by the
powers!<br>
 'Short and sweet' is my motto."</p>

<p>" 'Long and happy' is more to my mind," returned Crevel.</p>

<p>Madame Marneffe now came in; she saw that her husband was at
cards<br>
 with Crevel, and only the Baron in the room besides; a mere
glance at<br>
 the municipal dignitary showed her the frame of mind he was in,
and<br>
 her line of conduct was at once decided on.</p>

<p>"Marneffe, my dear boy," said she, leaning on her husband's
shoulder,<br>
 and passing her pretty fingers through his dingy gray hair,
but<br>
 without succeeding in covering his bald head with it, "it is
very late<br>
 for you; you ought to be in bed. To-morrow, you know, you must
dose<br>
 yourself by the doctor's orders. Reine will give you your herb
tea at<br>
 seven. If you wish to live, give up your game."</p>

<p>"We will pay it out up to five points," said Marneffe to
Crevel.</p>

<p>"Very good--I have scored two," replied the Mayor.</p>

<p>"How long will it take you?"</p>

<p>"Ten minutes," said Marneffe.</p>

<p>"It is eleven o'clock," replied Valerie. "Really, Monsieur
Crevel, one<br>
 might fancy you meant to kill my husband. Make haste, at any
rate."</p>

<p>This double-barreled speech made Crevel and Hulot smile, and
even<br>
 Marneffe himself. Valerie sat down to talk to Hector.</p>

<p>"You must leave, my dearest," said she in Hulot's ear. "Walk
up and<br>
 down the Rue Vanneau, and come in again when you see Crevel go
out."</p>

<p>"I would rather leave this room and go into your room through
the<br>
 dressing-room door. You could tell Reine to let me in."</p>

<p>"Reine is upstairs attending to Lisbeth."</p>

<p>"Well, suppose then I go up to Lisbeth's rooms?"</p>

<p>Danger hemmed in Valerie on every side; she foresaw a
discussion with<br>
 Crevel, and could not allow Hulot to be in her room, where he
could<br>
 hear all that went on.--And the Brazilian was upstairs with
Lisbeth.</p>

<p>"Really, you men, when you have a notion in your head, you
would burn<br>
 a house down to get into it!" exclaimed she. "Lisbeth is not in
a fit<br>
 state to admit you.--Are you afraid of catching cold in the
street? Be<br>
 off there--or good-night."</p>

<p>"Good evening, gentlemen," said the Baron to the other
two.</p>

<p>Hulot, when piqued in his old man's vanity, was bent on
proving that<br>
 he could play the young man by waiting for the happy hour in the
open<br>
 air, and he went away.</p>

<p>Marneffe bid his wife good-night, taking her hands with a
semblance of<br>
 devotion. Valerie pressed her husband's hand with a
significant<br>
 glance, conveying:</p>

<p>"Get rid of Crevel."</p>

<p>"Good-night, Crevel," said Marneffe. "I hope you will not stay
long<br>
 with Valerie. Yes! I am jealous--a little late in the day, but
it has<br>
 me hard and fast. I shall come back to see if you are gone."</p>

<p>"We have a little business to discuss, but I shall not stay
long,"<br>
 said Crevel.</p>

<p>"Speak low.--What is it?" said Valerie, raising her voice, and
looking<br>
 at him with a mingled expression of haughtiness and scorn.</p>

<p>Crevel, as he met this arrogant stare, though he was doing
Valerie<br>
 important services, and had hoped to plume himself on the fact,
was at<br>
 once reduced to submission.</p>

<p>"That Brazilian----" he began, but, overpowered by Valerie's
fixed<br>
 look of contempt, he broke off.</p>

<p>"What of him?" said she.</p>

<p>"That cousin--"</p>

<p>"Is no cousin of mine," said she. "He is my cousin to the
world and to<br>
 Monsieur Marneffe. And if he were my lover, it would be no
concern of<br>
 yours. A tradesman who pays a woman to be revenged on another
man, is,<br>
 in my opinion, beneath the man who pays her for love of her. You
did<br>
 not care for me; all you saw in me was Monsieur Hulot's
mistress. You<br>
 bought me as a man buys a pistol to kill his adversary. I
wanted<br>
 bread--I accepted the bargain."</p>

<p>"But you have not carried it out," said Crevel, the tradesman
once<br>
 more.</p>

<p>"You want Baron Hulot to be told that you have robbed him of
his<br>
 mistress, to pay him out for having robbed you of Josepha?
Nothing can<br>
 more clearly prove your baseness. You say you love a woman, you
treat<br>
 her like a duchess, and then you want to degrade her? Well, my
good<br>
 fellow, and you are right. This woman is no match for Josepha.
That<br>
 young person has the courage of her disgrace, while I--I am
a<br>
 hypocrite, and deserve to be publicly whipped.--Alas! Josepha
is<br>
 protected by her cleverness and her wealth. I have nothing to
shelter<br>
 me but my reputation; I am still the worthy and blameless wife
of a<br>
 plain citizen; if you create a scandal, what is to become of me?
If I<br>
 were rich, then indeed; but my income is fifteen thousand francs
a<br>
 year at most, I suppose."</p>

<p><br>
 "Much more than that," said Crevel. "I have doubled your savings
in<br>
 these last two months by investing in <i>Orleans</i>."</p>

<p>"Well, a position in Paris begins with fifty thousand. And
you<br>
 certainly will not make up to me for the position I should
surrender.<br>
 --What was my aim? I want to see Marneffe a first-class clerk;
he will<br>
 then draw a salary of six thousand francs. He has been
twenty-seven<br>
 years in his office; within three years I shall have a right to
a<br>
 pension of fifteen hundred francs when he dies. You, to whom I
have<br>
 been entirely kind, to whom I have given your fill of
happiness--you<br>
 cannot wait!--And that is what men call love!" she
exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Though I began with an ulterior purpose," said Crevel, "I
have become<br>
 your poodle. You trample on my heart, you crush me, you stultify
me,<br>
 and I love you as I have never loved in my life. Valerie, I love
you<br>
 as much as I love my Celestine. I am capable of anything for
your<br>
 sake.--Listen, instead of coming twice a week to the Rue du
Dauphin,<br>
 come three times."</p>

<p>"Is that all! You are quite young again, my dear boy!"</p>

<p>"Only let me pack off Hulot, humiliate him, rid you of him,"
said<br>
 Crevel, not heeding her impertinence! "Have nothing to say to
the<br>
 Brazilian, be mine alone; you shall not repent of it. To begin
with, I<br>
 will give you eight thousand francs a year, secured by bond, but
only<br>
 as an annuity; I will not give you the capital till the end of
five<br>
 years' constancy--"</p>

<p>"Always a bargain! A tradesman can never learn to give. You
want to<br>
 stop for refreshments on the road of love--in the form of
Government<br>
 bonds! Bah! Shopman, pomatum seller! you put a price on
everything!--<br>
 Hector told me that the Duc d'Herouville gave Josepha a bond
for<br>
 thirty thousand francs a year in a packet of sugar almonds! And
I am<br>
 worth six of Josepha.</p>

<p>"Oh! to be loved!" she went on, twisting her ringlets round
her<br>
 fingers, and looking at herself in the glass. "Henri loves me.
He<br>
 would smash you like a fly if I winked at him! Hulot loves me;
he<br>
 leaves his wife in beggary! As for you, go my good man, be the
worthy<br>
 father of a family. You have three hundred thousand francs over
and<br>
 above your fortune, only to amuse yourself, a hoard, in fact,
and you<br>
 think of nothing but increasing it--"</p>

<p>"For you, Valerie, since I offer you half," said he, falling
on his<br>
 knees.</p>

<p>"What, still here!" cried Marneffe, hideous in his
dressing-gown.<br>
 "What are you about?"</p>

<p>"He is begging my pardon, my dear, for an insulting proposal
he has<br>
 dared to make me. Unable to obtain my consent, my gentleman
proposed<br>
 to pay me----"</p>

<p>Crevel only longed to vanish into the cellar, through a trap,
as is<br>
 done on the stage.</p>

<p>"Get up, Crevel," said Marneffe, laughing, "you are
ridiculous. I can<br>
 see by Valerie's manner that my honor is in no danger."</p>

<p>"Go to bed and sleep in peace," said Madame Marneffe.</p>

<p>"Isn't she clever?" thought Crevel. "She has saved me. She
is<br>
 adorable!"</p>

<p>As Marneffe disappeared, the Mayor took Valerie's hands and
kissed<br>
 them, leaving on them the traces of tears.</p>

<p>"It shall all stand in your name," he said.</p>

<p>"That is true love," she whispered in his ear. "Well, love for
love.<br>
 Hulot is below, in the street. The poor old thing is waiting to
return<br>
 when I place a candle in one of the windows of my bedroom. I
give you<br>
 leave to tell him that you are the man I love; he will refuse
to<br>
 believe you; take him to the Rue du Dauphin, give him every
proof,<br>
 crush him; I allow it--I order it! I am tired of that old seal;
he<br>
 bores me to death. Keep your man all night in the Rue du
Dauphin,<br>
 grill him over a slow fire, be revenged for the loss of Josepha.
Hulot<br>
 may die of it perhaps, but we shall save his wife and children
from<br>
 utter ruin. Madame Hulot is working for her bread--"</p>

<p>"Oh! poor woman! On my word, it is quite shocking!" exclaimed
Crevel,<br>
 his natural feeling coming to the top.</p>

<p>"If you love me, Celestin," said she in Crevel's ear, which
she<br>
 touched with her lips, "keep him there, or I am done for.
Marneffe is<br>
 suspicious. Hector has a key of the outer gate, and will
certainly<br>
 come back."</p>

<p>Crevel clasped Madame Marneffe to his heart, and went away in
the<br>
 seventh heaven of delight. Valerie fondly escorted him to the
landing,<br>
 and then followed him, like a woman magnetized, down the stairs
to the<br>
 very bottom.</p>

<p>"My Valerie, go back, do not compromise yourself before the
porters.--<br>
 Go back; my life, my treasure, all is yours.--Go in, my
duchess!"</p>

<p>"Madame Olivier," Valerie called gently when the gate was
closed.</p>

<p>"Why, madame! You here?" said the woman in bewilderment.</p>

<p>"Bolt the gates at top and bottom, and let no one in."</p>

<p>"Very good, madame."</p>

<p>Having barred the gate, Madame Olivier told of the bribe that
the War<br>
 Office chief had tried to offer her.</p>

<p>"You behaved like an angel, my dear Olivier; we shall talk of
that<br>
 to-morrow."</p>

<p>Valerie flew like an arrow to the third floor, tapped three
times at<br>
 Lisbeth's door, and then went down to her room, where she
gave<br>
 instructions to Mademoiselle Reine, for a woman must make the
most of<br>
 the opportunity when a Montes arrives from Brazil.</p>

<p>"By Heaven! only a woman of the world is capable of such
love," said<br>
 Crevel to himself. "How she came down those stairs, lighting
them up<br>
 with her eyes, following me! Never did Josepha--Josepha! she is
cag-<br>
 mag!" cried the ex-bagman. "What have I said?
<i>Cag-mag</i>--why, I might<br>
 have let the word slip out at the Tuileries! I can never do any
good<br>
 unless Valerie educates me--and I was so bent on being a
gentleman.--<br>
 What a woman she is! She upsets me like a fit of the colic when
she<br>
 looks at me coldly. What grace! What wit! Never did Josepha move
me<br>
 so. And what perfection when you come to know her!--Ha, there is
my<br>
 man!"</p>

<p>He perceived in the gloom of the Rue de Babylone the tall,
somewhat<br>
 stooping figure of Hulot, stealing along close to a boarding,
and he<br>
 went straight up to him.</p>

<p>"Good-morning, Baron, for it is past midnight, my dear fellow.
What<br>
 the devil are your doing here? You are airing yourself under
a<br>
 pleasant drizzle. That is not wholesome at our time of life.
Will you<br>
 let me give you a little piece of advice? Let each of us go
home; for,<br>
 between you and me, you will not see the candle in the
window."</p>

<p>The last words made the Baron suddenly aware that he was
sixty-three,<br>
 and that his cloak was wet.</p>

<p>"Who on earth told you--?" he began.</p>

<p>"Valerie, of course, <i>our</i> Valerie, who means henceforth
to be <i>my</i><br>
 Valerie. We are even now, Baron; we will play off the tie when
you<br>
 please. You have nothing to complain of; you know, I always
stipulated<br>
 for the right of taking my revenge; it took you three months to
rob me<br>
 of Josepha; I took Valerie from you in--We will say no more
about<br>
 that. Now I mean to have her all to myself. But we can be very
good<br>
 friends, all the same."</p>

<p>"Crevel, no jesting," said Hulot, in a voice choked by rage.
"It is a<br>
 matter of life and death."</p>

<p>"Bless me, is that how you take it!--Baron, do you not
remember what<br>
 you said to me the day of Hortense's marriage: 'Can two old
gaffers<br>
 like us quarrel over a petticoat? It is too low, too common. We
are<br>
 <i>Regence</i>, we agreed, Pompadour, eighteenth century, quite
the<br>
 Marechal Richelieu, Louis XV., nay, and I may say,
<i>Liaisons</i><br>
 <i>dangereuses</i>!"</p>

<p>Crevel might have gone on with his string of literary
allusions; the<br>
 Baron heard him as a deaf man listens when he is but half deaf.
But,<br>
 seeing in the gaslight the ghastly pallor of his face, the
triumphant<br>
 Mayor stopped short. This was, indeed, a thunderbolt after
Madame<br>
 Olivier's asservations and Valerie's parting glance.</p>

<p>"Good God! And there are so many other women in Paris!" he
said at<br>
 last.</p>

<p>"That is what I said to you when you took Josepha," said
Crevel.</p>

<p>"Look here, Crevel, it is impossible. Give me some
proof.--Have you a<br>
 key, as I have, to let yourself in?"</p>

<p>And having reached the house, the Baron put the key into the
lock; but<br>
 the gate was immovable; he tried in vain to open it.</p>

<p>"Do not make a noise in the streets at night," said Crevel
coolly. "I<br>
 tell you, Baron, I have far better proof than you can show."</p>

<p>"Proofs! give me proof!" cried the Baron, almost crazy
with<br>
 exasperation.</p>

<p>"Come, and you shall have them," said Crevel.</p>

<p>And in obedience to Valerie's instructions, he led the Baron
away<br>
 towards the quay, down the Rue Hillerin-Bertin. The unhappy
Baron<br>
 walked on, as a merchant walks on the day before he stops
payment; he<br>
 was lost in conjectures as to the reasons of the depravity
buried in<br>
 the depths of Valerie's heart, and still believed himself the
victim<br>
 of some practical joke. As they crossed the Pont Royal, life
seemed to<br>
 him so blank, so utterly a void, and so out of joint from
his<br>
 financial difficulties, that he was within an ace of yielding to
the<br>
 evil prompting that bid him fling Crevel into the river and
throw<br>
 himself in after.</p>

<p>On reaching the Rue du Dauphin, which had not yet been
widened, Crevel<br>
 stopped before a door in a wall. It opened into a long corridor
paved<br>
 with black-and-white marble, and serving as an entrance-hall, at
the<br>
 end of which there was a flight of stairs and a doorkeeper's
lodge,<br>
 lighted from an inner courtyard, as is often the case in Paris.
This<br>
 courtyard, which was shared with another house, was oddly
divided into<br>
 two unequal portions. Crevel's little house, for he owned it,
had<br>
 additional rooms with a glass skylight, built out on to the
adjoining<br>
 plot, under conditions that it should have no story added above
the<br>
 ground floor, so that the structure was entirely hidden by the
lodge<br>
 and the projecting mass of the staircase.</p>

<p>This back building had long served as a store-room, backshop,
and<br>
 kitchen to one of the shops facing the street. Crevel had cut
off<br>
 these three rooms from the rest of the ground floor, and Grindot
had<br>
 transformed them into an inexpensive private residence. There
were two<br>
 ways in--from the front, through the shop of a furniture-dealer,
to<br>
 whom Crevel let it at a low price, and only from month to month,
so as<br>
 to be able to get rid of him in case of his telling tales, and
also<br>
 through a door in the wall of the passage, so ingeniously hidden
as to<br>
 be almost invisible. The little apartment, comprising a
dining-room,<br>
 drawing-room, and bedroom, all lighted from above, and standing
partly<br>
 on Crevel's ground and partly on his neighbor's, was very
difficult to<br>
 find. With the exception of the second-hand furniture-dealer,
the<br>
 tenants knew nothing of the existence of this little
paradise.</p>

<p>The doorkeeper, paid to keep Crevel's secrets, was a capital
cook. So<br>
 Monsieur le Maire could go in and out of his inexpensive retreat
at<br>
 any hour of the night without any fear of being spied upon. By
day, a<br>
 lady, dressed as Paris women dress to go shopping, and having a
key,<br>
 ran no risk in coming to Crevel's lodgings; she would stop to
look at<br>
 the cheapened goods, ask the price, go into the shop, and come
out<br>
 again, without exciting the smallest suspicion if any one
should<br>
 happen to meet her.</p>

<p>As soon as Crevel had lighted the candles in the sitting-room,
the<br>
 Baron was surprised at the elegance and refinement it displayed.
The<br>
 perfumer had given the architect a free hand, and Grindot had
done<br>
 himself credit by fittings in the Pompadour style, which had in
fact<br>
 cost sixty thousand francs.</p>

<p>"What I want," said Crevel to Grindot, "is that a duchess, if
I<br>
 brought one there, should be surprised at it."</p>

<p>He wanted to have a perfect Parisian Eden for his Eve, his
"real<br>
 lady," his Valerie, his duchess.</p>

<p>"There are two beds," said Crevel to Hulot, showing him a sofa
that<br>
 could be made wide enough by pulling out a drawer. "This is one,
the<br>
 other is in the bedroom. We can both spend the night here."</p>

<p>"Proof!" was all the Baron could say.</p>

<p>Crevel took a flat candlestick and led Hulot into the
adjoining room,<br>
 where he saw, on a sofa, a superb dressing-gown belonging to
Valerie,<br>
 which he had seen her wear in the Rue Vanneau, to display it
before<br>
 wearing it in Crevel's little apartment. The Mayor pressed the
spring<br>
 of a little writing-table of inlaid work, known as a
<i>bonheur-du-</i><br>
 <i>jour</i>, and took out of it a letter that he handed to the
Baron.</p>

<p>"Read that," said he.</p>

<p>The Councillor read these words written in pencil:</p>

<p>"I have waited in vain, you old wretch! A woman of my quality
does<br>
 not expect to be kept waiting by a retired perfumer. There was
no<br>
 dinner ordered--no cigarettes. I will make you pay for
this!"</p>

<p>"Well, is that her writing?"</p>

<p>"Good God!" gasped Hulot, sitting down in dismay. "I see all
the<br>
 things she uses--her caps, her slippers. Why, how long
since--?"</p>

<p>Crevel nodded that he understood, and took a packet of bills
out of<br>
 the little inlaid cabinet.</p>

<p>"You can see, old man. I paid the decorators in December,
1838. In<br>
 October, two months before, this charming little place was
first<br>
 used."</p>

<p>Hulot bent his head.</p>

<p>"How the devil do you manage it? I know how she spends every
hour of<br>
 her day."</p>

<p>"How about her walk in the Tuileries?" said Crevel, rubbing
his hands<br>
 in triumph.</p>

<p>"What then?" said Hulot, mystified.</p>

<p>"Your lady love comes to the Tuileries, she is supposed to be
airing<br>
 herself from one till four. But, hop, skip, and jump, and she is
here.<br>
 You know your Moliere? Well, Baron, there is nothing imaginary
in your<br>
 title."</p>

<p>Hulot, left without a shred of doubt, sat sunk in ominous
silence.<br>
 Catastrophes lead intelligent and strong-minded men to be<br>
 philosophical. The Baron, morally, was at this moment like a
man<br>
 trying to find his way by night through a forest. This
gloomy<br>
 taciturnity and the change in that dejected countenance made
Crevel<br>
 very uneasy, for he did not wish the death of his colleague.</p>

<p>"As I said, old fellow, we are now even; let us play for the
odd. Will<br>
 you play off the tie by hook and by crook? Come!"</p>

<p>"Why," said Hulot, talking to himself--"why is it that out of
ten<br>
 pretty women at least seven are false?"</p>

<p>But the Baron was too much upset to answer his own question.
Beauty is<br>
 the greatest of human gifts for power. Every power that has
no<br>
 counterpoise, no autocratic control, leads to abuses and
folly.<br>
 Despotism is the madness of power; in women the despot is
caprice.</p>

<p>"You have nothing to complain of, my good friend; you have a
beautiful<br>
 wife, and she is virtuous."</p>

<p>"I deserve my fate," said Hulot. "I have undervalued my wife
and made<br>
 her miserable, and she is an angel! Oh, my poor Adeline! you
are<br>
 avenged! She suffers in solitude and silence, and she is worthy
of my<br>
 love; I ought--for she is still charming, fair and girlish
even--But<br>
 was there ever a woman known more base, more ignoble, more
villainous<br>
 than this Valerie?"</p>

<p>"She is a good-for-nothing slut," said Crevel, "a hussy that
deserves<br>
 whipping on the Place du Chatelet. But, my dear Canillac, though
we<br>
 are such blades, so Marechal de Richelieu, Louis XV.,
Pompadour,<br>
 Madame du Barry, gay dogs, and everything that is most
eighteenth<br>
 century, there is no longer a lieutenant of police."</p>

<p>"How can we make them love us?" Hulot wondered to himself
without<br>
 heeding Crevel.</p>

<p>"It is sheer folly in us to expect to be loved, my dear
fellow," said<br>
 Crevel. "We can only be endured; for Madame Marneffe is a
hundred<br>
 times more profligate than Josepha."</p>

<p>"And avaricious! she costs me a hundred and ninety-two
thousand francs<br>
 a year!" cried Hulot.</p>

<p>"And how many centimes!" sneered Crevel, with the insolence of
a<br>
 financier who scorns so small a sum.</p>

<p>"You do not love her, that is very evident," said the Baron
dolefully.</p>

<p>"I have had enough of her," replied Crevel, "for she has had
more than<br>
 three hundred thousand francs of mine!"</p>

<p>"Where is it? Where does it all go?" said the Baron, clasping
his head<br>
 in his hands.</p>

<p>"If we had come to an agreement, like the simple young men who
combine<br>
 to maintain a twopenny baggage, she would have cost us
less."</p>

<p>"That is an idea"! replied the Baron. "But she would still be
cheating<br>
 us; for, my burly friend, what do you say to this
Brazilian?"</p>

<p>"Ay, old sly fox, you are right, we are swindled
like--like<br>
 shareholders!" said Crevel. "All such women are an unlimited<br>
 liability, and we the sleeping partners."</p>

<p>"Then it was she who told you about the candle in the
window?"</p>

<p>"My good man," replied Crevel, striking an attitude, "she has
fooled<br>
 us both. Valerie is a--She told me to keep you here.--Now I see
it<br>
 all. She has got her Brazilian!--Oh, I have done with her, for
if you<br>
 hold her hands, she would find a way to cheat you with her
feet!<br>
 There! she is a minx, a jade!"</p>

<p>"She is lower than a prostitute," said the Baron. "Josepha and
Jenny<br>
 Cadine were in their rights when they were false to us; they
make a<br>
 trade of their charms."</p>

<p>"But she, who affects the saint--the prude!" said Crevel. "I
tell you<br>
 what, Hulot, do you go back to your wife; your money matters are
not<br>
 looking well; I have heard talk of certain notes of hand given
to a<br>
 low usurer whose special line of business is lending to these
sluts, a<br>
 man named Vauvinet. For my part, I am cured of your 'real
ladies.'<br>
 And, after all, at our time of life what do we want of these
swindling<br>
 hussies, who, to be honest, cannot help playing us false? You
have<br>
 white hair and false teeth; I am of the shape of Silenus. I
shall go<br>
 in for saving. Money never deceives one. Though the Treasury is
indeed<br>
 open to all the world twice a year, it pays you interest, and
this<br>
 woman swallows it. With you, my worthy friend, as Gubetta, as
my<br>
 partner in the concern, I might have resigned myself to a
shady<br>
 bargain--no, a philosophical calm. But with a Brazilian who
has<br>
 possibly smuggled in some doubtful colonial produce----"</p>

<p><br>
 "Woman is an inexplicable creature!" said Hulot.</p>

<p>"I can explain her," said Crevel. "We are old; the Brazilian
is young<br>
 and handsome."</p>

<p>"Yes; that, I own, is true," said Hulot; "we are older than we
were.<br>
 But, my dear fellow, how is one to do without these pretty
creatures--<br>
 seeing them undress, twist up their hair, smile cunningly
through<br>
 their fingers as they screw up their curl-papers, put on all
their<br>
 airs and graces, tell all their lies, declare that we don't love
them<br>
 when we are worried with business; and they cheer us in spite
of<br>
 everything."</p>

<p>"Yes, by the Power! It is the only pleasure in life!" cried
Crevel.<br>
 "When a saucy little mug smiles at you and says, 'My old dear,
you<br>
 don't know how nice you are! I am not like other women, I
suppose, who<br>
 go crazy over mere boys with goats' beards, smelling of smoke,
and as<br>
 coarse as serving-men! For in their youth they are so
insolent!--They<br>
 come in and they bid you good-morning, and out they go.--I, whom
you<br>
 think such a flirt, I prefer a man of fifty to these brats. A
man who<br>
 will stick by me, who is devoted, who knows a woman is not to
be<br>
 picked up every day, and appreciates us.--That is what I love
you for,<br>
 you old monster!'--and they fill up these avowals with little
pettings<br>
 and prettinesses and--Faugh! they are as false as the bills on
the<br>
 Hotel de Ville."</p>

<p>"A lie is sometimes better than the truth," said Hulot,
remembering<br>
 sundry bewitching scenes called up by Crevel, who mimicked
Valerie.<br>
 "They are obliged to act upon their lies, to sew spangles on
their<br>
 stage frocks--"</p>

<p>"And they are ours, after all, the lying jades!" said Crevel
coarsely.</p>

<p>"Valerie is a witch," said the Baron. "She can turn an old man
into a<br>
 young one."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes!" said Crevel, "she is an eel that wriggles through
your<br>
 hands; but the prettiest eel, as white and sweet as sugar, as
amusing<br>
 as Arnal--and ingenious!"</p>

<p>"Yes, she is full of fun," said Hulot, who had now quite
forgotten his<br>
 wife.</p>

<p>The colleagues went to bed the best friends in the world,
reminding<br>
 each other of Valerie's perfections, the tones of her voice,
her<br>
 kittenish way, her movements, her fun, her sallies of wit, and
of<br>
 affections; for she was an artist in love, and had charming
impulses,<br>
 as tenors may sing a scena better one day than another. And they
fell<br>
 asleep, cradled in tempting and diabolical visions lighted by
the<br>
 fires of hell.</p>

<p>At nine o'clock next morning Hulot went off to the War Office,
Crevel<br>
 had business out of town; they left the house together, and
Crevel<br>
 held out his hand to the Baron, saying:</p>

<p>"To show that there is no ill-feeling. For we, neither of us,
will<br>
 have anything more to say to Madame Marneffe?"</p>

<p>"Oh, this is the end of everything," replied Hulot with a sort
of<br>
 horror.</p>

<p>By half-past ten Crevel was mounting the stairs, four at a
time, up to<br>
 Madame Marneffe's apartment. He found the infamous wretch,
the<br>
 adorable enchantress, in the most becoming morning wrapper,
enjoying<br>
 an elegant little breakfast in the society of the Baron Montes
de<br>
 Montejanos and Lisbeth. Though the sight of the Brazilian gave
him a<br>
 shock, Crevel begged Madame Marneffe to grant him two minutes'
speech<br>
 with her. Valerie led Crevel into the drawing-room.</p>

<p>"Valerie, my angel," said the amorous Mayor, "Monsieur
Marneffe cannot<br>
 have long to live. If you will be faithful to me, when he dies
we will<br>
 be married. Think it over. I have rid you of Hulot.--So just
consider<br>
 whether this Brazilian is to compare with a Mayor of Paris, a
man who,<br>
 for your sake, will make his way to the highest dignities, and
who can<br>
 already offer you eighty-odd thousand francs a year."</p>

<p>"I will think it over," said she. "You will see me in the Rue
du<br>
 Dauphin at two o'clock, and we can discuss the matter. But be a
good<br>
 boy--and do not forget the bond you promised to transfer to
me."</p>

<p>She returned to the dining-room, followed by Crevel, who
flattered<br>
 himself that he had hit on a plan for keeping Valerie to
himself; but<br>
 there he found Baron Hulot, who, during this short colloquy, had
also<br>
 arrived with the same end in view. He, like Crevel, begged for a
brief<br>
 interview. Madame Marneffe again rose to go to the drawing-room,
with<br>
 a smile at the Brazilian that seemed to say, "What fools they
are!<br>
 Cannot they see you?"</p>

<p>"Valerie," said the official, "my child, that cousin of yours
is an<br>
 American cousin--"</p>

<p>"Oh, that is enough!" she cried, interrupting the Baron.
"Marneffe<br>
 never has been, and never will be, never can be my husband! The
first,<br>
 the only man I ever loved, has come back quite unexpectedly. It
is no<br>
 fault of mine! But look at Henri and look at yourself. Then
ask<br>
 yourself whether a woman, and a woman in love, can hesitate for
a<br>
 moment. My dear fellow, I am not a kept mistress. From this day
forth<br>
 I refuse to play the part of Susannah between the two Elders. If
you<br>
 really care for me, you and Crevel, you will be our friends; but
all<br>
 else is at an end, for I am six-and-twenty, and henceforth I
mean to<br>
 be a saint, an admirable and worthy wife--as yours is."</p>

<p>"Is that what you have to say?" answered Hulot. "Is this the
way you<br>
 receive me when I come like a Pope with my hands full of
Indulgences?<br>
 --Well, your husband will never be a first-class clerk, nor
be<br>
 promoted in the Legion of Honor."</p>

<p>"That remains to be seen," said Madame Marneffe, with a
meaning look<br>
 at Hulot.</p>

<p>"Well, well, no temper," said Hulot in despair. "I will call
this<br>
 evening, and we will come to an understanding."</p>

<p>"In Lisbeth's rooms then."</p>

<p>"Very good--at Lisbeth's," said the old dotard.</p>

<p>Hulot and Crevel went downstairs together without speaking a
word till<br>
 they were in the street; but outside on the sidewalk they looked
at<br>
 each other with a dreary laugh.</p>

<p>"We are a couple of old fools," said Crevel.</p>

<p>"I have got rid of them," said Madame Marneffe to Lisbeth, as
she sat<br>
 down once more. "I never loved and I never shall love any man
but my<br>
 Jaguar," she added, smiling at Henri Montes. "Lisbeth, my dear,
you<br>
 don't know. Henri has forgiven me the infamy to which I was
reduced by<br>
 poverty."</p>

<p>"It was my own fault," said the Brazilian. "I ought to have
sent you a<br>
 hundred thousand francs."</p>

<p>"Poor boy!" said Valerie; "I might have worked for my living,
but my<br>
 fingers were not made for that--ask Lisbeth."</p>

<p>The Brazilian went away the happiest man in Paris.</p>

<p>At noon Valerie and Lisbeth were chatting in the splendid
bedroom<br>
 where this dangerous woman was giving to her dress those
finishing<br>
 touches which a lady alone can give. The doors were bolted,
the<br>
 curtains drawn over them, and Valerie related in every detail
all the<br>
 events of the evening, the night, the morning.</p>

<p>"What do you think of it all, my darling?" she said to Lisbeth
in<br>
 conclusion. "Which shall I be when the time comes--Madame
Crevel, or<br>
 Madame Montes?"</p>

<p>"Crevel will not last more than ten years, such a profligate
as he<br>
 is," replied Lisbeth. "Montes is young. Crevel will leave you
about<br>
 thirty thousand francs a year. Let Montes wait; he will be
happy<br>
 enough as Benjamin. And so, by the time you are
three-and-thirty, if<br>
 you take care of your looks, you may marry your Brazilian and
make a<br>
 fine show with sixty thousand francs a year of your
own--especially<br>
 under the wing of a Marechale."</p>

<p>"Yes, but Montes is a Brazilian; he will never make his
mark,"<br>
 observed Valerie.</p>

<p>"We live in the day of railways," said Lisbeth, "when
foreigners rise<br>
 to high positions in France."</p>

<p>"We shall see," replied Valerie, "when Marneffe is dead. He
has not<br>
 much longer to suffer."</p>

<p>"These attacks that return so often are a sort of physical
remorse,"<br>
 said Lisbeth. "Well, I am off to see Hortense."</p>

<p>"Yes--go, my angel!" replied Valerie. "And bring me my
artist.--Three<br>
 years, and I have not gained an inch of ground! It is a disgrace
to<br>
 both of us!--Wenceslas and Henri--these are my two passions--one
for<br>
 love, the other for fancy."</p>

<p>"You are lovely this morning," said Lisbeth, putting her arm
round<br>
 Valerie's waist and kissing her forehead. "I enjoy all your
pleasures,<br>
 your good fortune, your dresses--I never really lived till the
day<br>
 when we became sisters."</p>

<p>"Wait a moment, my tiger-cat!" cried Valerie, laughing; "your
shawl is<br>
 crooked. You cannot put a shawl on yet in spite of my lessons
for<br>
 three years--and you want to be Madame la Marechale Hulot!"</p>

<p>Shod in prunella boots, over gray silk stockings, in a gown
of<br>
 handsome corded silk, her hair in smooth bands under a very
pretty<br>
 black velvet bonnet, lined with yellow satin, Lisbeth made her
way to<br>
 the Rue Saint-Dominique by the Boulevard des Invalides,
wondering<br>
 whether sheer dejection would at last break down Hortense's
brave<br>
 spirit, and whether Sarmatian instability, taken at a moment
when,<br>
 with such a character, everything is possible, would be too much
for<br>
 Steinbock's constancy.</p>

<p>Hortense and Wenceslas had the ground floor of a house
situated at the<br>
 corner of the Rue Saint-Dominique and the Esplanade des
Invalides.<br>
 These rooms, once in harmony with the honeymoon, now had that
half-<br>
 new, half-faded look that may be called the autumnal aspect
of<br>
 furniture. Newly married folks are as lavish and wasteful,
without<br>
 knowing it or intending it, of everything about them as they are
of<br>
 their affection. Thinking only of themselves, they reck little
of the<br>
 future, which, at a later time, weighs on the mother of a
family.</p>

<p>Lisbeth found Hortense just as she had finished dressing a
baby<br>
 Wenceslas, who had been carried into the garden.</p>

<p>"Good-morning, Betty," said Hortense, opening the door herself
to her<br>
 cousin. The cook was gone out, and the house-servant, who was
also the<br>
 nurse, was doing some washing.</p>

<p>"Good-morning, dear child," replied Lisbeth, kissing her.
"Is<br>
 Wenceslas in the studio?" she added in a whisper.</p>

<p>"No; he is in the drawing-room talking to Stidmann and
Chanor."</p>

<p>"Can we be alone?" asked Lisbeth.</p>

<p>"Come into my room."</p>

<p>In this room, the hangings of pink-flowered chintz with green
leaves<br>
 on a white ground, constantly exposed to the sun, were much
faded, as<br>
 was the carpet. The muslin curtains had not been washed for many
a<br>
 day. The smell of tobacco hung about the room; for Wenceslas,
now an<br>
 artist of repute, and born a fine gentleman, left his cigar-ash
on the<br>
 arms of the chairs and the prettiest pieces of furniture, as a
man<br>
 does to whom love allows everything--a man rich enough to scorn
vulgar<br>
 carefulness.</p>

<p>"Now, then, let us talk over your affairs," said Lisbeth,
seeing her<br>
 pretty cousin silent in the armchair into which she had dropped.
"But<br>
 what ails you? You look rather pale, my dear."</p>

<p>"Two articles have just come out in which my poor Wenceslas is
pulled<br>
 to pieces; I have read them, but I have hidden them from him,
for they<br>
 would completely depress him. The marble statue of Marshal
Montcornet<br>
 is pronounced utterly bad. The bas-reliefs are allowed to pass
muster,<br>
 simply to allow of the most perfidious praise of his talent as
a<br>
 decorative artist, and to give the greater emphasis to the
statement<br>
 that serious art is quite out of his reach! Stidmann, whom I
besought<br>
 to tell me the truth, broke my heart by confessing that his
own<br>
 opinion agreed with that of every other artist, of the critics,
and<br>
 the public. He said to me in the garden before breakfast,
'If<br>
 Wenceslas cannot exhibit a masterpiece next season, he must give
up<br>
 heroic sculpture and be content to execute idyllic subjects,
small<br>
 figures, pieces of jewelry, and high-class goldsmiths' work!'
This<br>
 verdict is dreadful to me, for Wenceslas, I know, will never
accept<br>
 it; he feels he has so many fine ideas."</p>

<p>"Ideas will not pay the tradesman's bills," remarked Lisbeth.
"I was<br>
 always telling him so--nothing but money. Money is only to be
had for<br>
 work done--things that ordinary folks like well enough to buy
them.<br>
 When an artist has to live and keep a family, he had far better
have a<br>
 design for a candlestick on his counter, or for a fender or a
table,<br>
 than for groups or statues. Everybody must have such things,
while he<br>
 may wait months for the admirer of the group--and for his
money---"</p>

<p>"You are right, my good Lisbeth. Tell him all that; I have not
the<br>
 courage.--Besides, as he was saying to Stidmann, if he goes back
to<br>
 ornamental work and small sculpture, he must give up all hope of
the<br>
 Institute and grand works of art, and we should not get the
three<br>
 hundred thousand francs' worth of work promised at Versailles
and by<br>
 the City of Paris and the Ministers. That is what we are robbed
of by<br>
 those dreadful articles, written by rivals who want to step into
our<br>
 shoes."</p>

<p>"And that is not what you dreamed of, poor little puss!" said
Lisbeth,<br>
 kissing Hortense on the brow. "You expected to find a gentleman,
a<br>
 leader of Art, the chief of all living sculptors.--But that is
poetry,<br>
 you see, a dream requiring fifty thousand francs a year, and you
have<br>
 only two thousand four hundred--so long as I live. After my
death<br>
 three thousand."</p>

<p>A few tears rose to Hortense's eyes, and Lisbeth drank them
with her<br>
 eyes as a cat laps milk.</p>

<p>This is the story of their honeymoon--the tale will perhaps
not be<br>
 lost on some artists.</p>

<p>Intellectual work, labor in the upper regions of mental
effort, is one<br>
 of the grandest achievements of man. That which deserves real
glory in<br>
 Art--for by Art we must understand every creation of the
mind--is<br>
 courage above all things--a sort of courage of which the vulgar
have<br>
 no conception, and which has never perhaps been described till
now.</p>

<p>Driven by the dreadful stress of poverty, goaded by Lisbeth,
and kept<br>
 by her in blinders, as a horse is, to hinder it from seeing to
the<br>
 right and left of its road, lashed on by that hard woman,
the<br>
 personification of Necessity, a sort of deputy Fate, Wenceslas,
a born<br>
 poet and dreamer, had gone on from conception to execution,
and<br>
 overleaped, without sounding it, the gulf that divides these
two<br>
 hemispheres of Art. To muse, to dream, to conceive of fine
works, is a<br>
 delightful occupation. It is like smoking a magic cigar or
leading the<br>
 life of a courtesan who follows her own fancy. The work then
floats in<br>
 all the grace of infancy, in the mad joy of conception, with
the<br>
 fragrant beauty of a flower, and the aromatic juices of a
fruit<br>
 enjoyed in anticipation.</p>

<p><br>
 The man who can sketch his purpose beforehand in words is
regarded as<br>
 a wonder, and every artist and writer possesses that faculty.
But<br>
 gestation, fruition, the laborious rearing of the offspring,
putting<br>
 it to bed every night full fed with milk, embracing it anew
every<br>
 morning with the inexhaustible affection of a mother's heart,
licking<br>
 it clean, dressing it a hundred times in the richest garb only
to be<br>
 instantly destroyed; then never to be cast down at the
convulsions of<br>
 this headlong life till the living masterpiece is perfected
which in<br>
 sculpture speaks to every eye, in literature to every intellect,
in<br>
 painting to every memory, in music to every heart!--This is the
task<br>
 of execution. The hand must be ready at every instant to come
forward<br>
 and obey the brain. But the brain has no more a creative power
at<br>
 command than love has a perennial spring.</p>

<p>The habit of creativeness, the indefatigable love of
motherhood which<br>
 makes a mother--that miracle of nature which Raphael so
perfectly<br>
 understood--the maternity of the brain, in short, which is
so<br>
 difficult to develop, is lost with prodigious ease. Inspiration
is the<br>
 opportunity of genius. She does not indeed dance on the razor's
edge,<br>
 she is in the air and flies away with the suspicious swiftness
of a<br>
 crow; she wears no scarf by which the poet can clutch her; her
hair is<br>
 a flame; she vanishes like the lovely rose and white flamingo,
the<br>
 sportsman's despair. And work, again, is a weariful struggle,
alike<br>
 dreaded and delighted in by these lofty and powerful natures who
are<br>
 often broken by it. A great poet of our day has said in speaking
of<br>
 this overwhelming labor, "I sit down to it in despair, but I
leave it<br>
 with regret." Be it known to all who are ignorant! If the artist
does<br>
 not throw himself into his work as Curtius sprang into the gulf,
as a<br>
 soldier leads a forlorn hope without a moment's thought, and if
when<br>
 he is in the crater he does not dig on as a miner does when the
earth<br>
 has fallen in on him; if he contemplates the difficulties before
him<br>
 instead of conquering them one by one, like the lovers in fairy
tales,<br>
 who to win their princesses overcome ever new enchantments, the
work<br>
 remains incomplete; it perishes in the studio where
creativeness<br>
 becomes impossible, and the artist looks on at the suicide of
his own<br>
 talent.</p>

<p>Rossini, a brother genius to Raphael, is a striking instance
in his<br>
 poverty-stricken youth, compared with his latter years of
opulence.<br>
 This is the reason why the same prize, the same triumph, the
same bays<br>
 are awarded to great poets and to great generals.</p>

<p>Wenceslas, by nature a dreamer, had expended so much energy
in<br>
 production, in study, and in work under Lisbeth's despotic rule,
that<br>
 love and happiness resulted in reaction. His real character<br>
 reappeared, the weakness, recklessness, and indolence of the
Sarmatian<br>
 returned to nestle in the comfortable corners of his soul,
whence the<br>
 schoolmaster's rod had routed them.</p>

<p>For the first few months the artist adored his wife. Hortense
and<br>
 Wenceslas abandoned themselves to the happy childishness of
a<br>
 legitimate and unbounded passion. Hortense was the first to
release<br>
 her husband from his labors, proud to triumph over her rival,
his Art.<br>
 And, indeed, a woman's caresses scare away the Muse, and break
down<br>
 the sturdy, brutal resolution of the worker.</p>

<p>Six or seven months slipped by, and the artist's fingers had
forgotten<br>
 the use of the modeling tool. When the need for work began to be
felt,<br>
 when the Prince de Wissembourg, president of the committee
of<br>
 subscribers, asked to see the statue, Wenceslas spoke the
inevitable<br>
 byword of the idler, "I am just going to work on it," and he
lulled<br>
 his dear Hortense with fallacious promises and the magnificent
schemes<br>
 of the artist as he smokes. Hortense loved her poet more than
ever;<br>
 she dreamed of a sublime statue of Marshal Montcornet.
Montcornet<br>
 would be the embodied ideal of bravery, the type of the
cavalry<br>
 officer, of courage <i>a la Murat</i>. Yes, yes; at the mere
sight of that<br>
 statue all the Emperor's victories were to seem a foregone
conclusion.<br>
 And then such workmanship! The pencil was accommodating and
answered<br>
 to the word.</p>

<p>By way of a statue the result was a delightful little
Wenceslas.</p>

<p>When the progress of affairs required that he should go to the
studio<br>
 at le Gros-Caillou to mould the clay and set up the life-size
model,<br>
 Steinbock found one day that the Prince's clock required his
presence<br>
 in the workshop of Florent and Chanor, where the figures were
being<br>
 finished; or, again, the light was gray and dull; to-day he
had<br>
 business to do, to-morrow they had a family dinner, to say
nothing of<br>
 indispositions of mind and body, and the days when he stayed at
home<br>
 to toy with his adored wife.</p>

<p>Marshal the Prince de Wissembourg was obliged to be angry to
get the<br>
 clay model finished; he declared that he must put the work into
other<br>
 hands. It was only by dint of endless complaints and much
strong<br>
 language that the committee of subscribers succeeded in seeing
the<br>
 plaster-cast. Day after day Steinbock came home, evidently
tired,<br>
 complaining of this "hodman's work" and his own physical
weakness.<br>
 During that first year the household felt no pinch; the
Countess<br>
 Steinbock, desperately in love with her husband cursed the
War<br>
 Minister. She went to see him; she told him that great works of
art<br>
 were not to be manufactured like cannon; and that the
State--like<br>
 Louis XIV., Francis I., and Leo X.--ought to be at the beck and
call<br>
 of genius. Poor Hortense, believing she held a Phidias in her
embrace,<br>
 had the sort of motherly cowardice for her Wenceslas that is in
every<br>
 wife who carries her love to the pitch of idolatry.</p>

<p>"Do not be hurried," said she to her husband, "our whole
future life<br>
 is bound up with that statue. Take your time and produce a<br>
 masterpiece."</p>

<p>She would go to the studio, and then the enraptured Steinbock
wasted<br>
 five hours out of seven in describing the statue instead of
working at<br>
 it. He thus spent eighteen months in finishing the design, which
to<br>
 him was all-important.</p>

<p>When the plaster was cast and the model complete, poor
Hortense, who<br>
 had looked on at her husband's toil, seeing his health really
suffer<br>
 from the exertions which exhaust a sculptor's frame and arms and
hands<br>
 --Hortense thought the result admirable. Her father, who knew
nothing<br>
 of sculpture, and her mother, no less ignorant, lauded it as
a<br>
 triumph; the War Minister came with them to see it, and,
overruled by<br>
 them, expressed approval of the figure, standing as it did
alone, in a<br>
 favorable light, thrown up against a green baize background.</p>

<p>Alas! at the exhibition of 1841, the disapprobation of the
public soon<br>
 took the form of abuse and mockery in the mouths of those who
were<br>
 indignant with the idol too hastily set up for worship. Stidmann
tried<br>
 to advise his friend, but was accused of jealousy. Every article
in a<br>
 newspaper was to Hortense an outcry of envy. Stidmann, the best
of<br>
 good fellows, got articles written, in which adverse criticism
was<br>
 contravened, and it was pointed out that sculptors altered their
works<br>
 in translating the plaster into marble, and that the marble
would be<br>
 the test.</p>

<p>"In reproducing the plaster sketch in marble," wrote Claude
Vignon, "a<br>
 masterpiece may be ruined, or a bad design made beautiful. The
plaster<br>
 is the manuscript, the marble is the book."</p>

<p>So in two years and a half Wenceslas had produced a statue and
a son.<br>
 The child was a picture of beauty; the statue was execrable.</p>

<p>The clock for the Prince and the price of the statue paid off
the<br>
 young couple's debts. Steinbock had acquired fashionable habits;
he<br>
 went to the play, to the opera; he talked admirably about art;
and in<br>
 the eyes of the world he maintained his reputation as a great
artist<br>
 by his powers of conversation and criticism. There are many
clever men<br>
 in Paris who spend their lives in talking themselves out, and
are<br>
 content with a sort of drawing-room celebrity. Steinbock,
emulating<br>
 these emasculated but charming men, grew every day more averse
to hard<br>
 work. As soon as he began a thing, he was conscious of all
its<br>
 difficulties, and the discouragement that came over him
enervated his<br>
 will. Inspiration, the frenzy of intellectual procreation,
flew<br>
 swiftly away at the sight of this effete lover.</p>

<p>Sculpture--like dramatic art--is at once the most difficult
and the<br>
 easiest of all arts. You have but to copy a model, and the task
is<br>
 done; but to give it a soul, to make it typical by creating a
man or a<br>
 woman--this is the sin of Prometheus. Such triumphs in the
annals of<br>
 sculpture may be counted, as we may count the few poets among
men.<br>
 Michael Angelo, Michel Columb, Jean Goujon, Phidias,
Praxiteles,<br>
 Polycletes, Puget, Canova, Albert Durer, are the brothers of
Milton,<br>
 Virgil, Dante, Shakespeare, Tasso, Homer, and Moliere. And such
an<br>
 achievement is so stupendous that a single statue is enough to
make a<br>
 man immortal, as Figaro, Lovelace, and Manon Lescaut have
immortalized<br>
 Beaumarchais, Richardson, and the Abbe Prevost.</p>

<p>Superficial thinkers--and there are many in the artist
world--have<br>
 asserted that sculpture lives only by the nude, that it died
with the<br>
 Greeks, and that modern vesture makes it impossible. But, in the
first<br>
 place, the Ancients have left sublime statues entirely
clothed--the<br>
 <i>Polyhymnia</i>, the <i>Julia</i>, and others, and we have not
found one-tenth<br>
 of all their works; and then, let any lover of art go to
Florence and<br>
 see Michael Angelo's <i>Penseroso</i>, or to the Cathedral of
Mainz, and<br>
 behold the <i>Virgin</i> by Albert Durer, who has created a
living woman<br>
 out of ebony, under her threefold drapery, with the most
flowing, the<br>
 softest hair that ever a waiting-maid combed through; let all
the<br>
 ignorant flock thither, and they will acknowledge that genius
can give<br>
 mind to drapery, to armor, to a robe, and fill it with a body,
just as<br>
 a man leaves the stamp of his individuality and habits of life
on the<br>
 clothes he wears.</p>

<p>Sculpture is the perpetual realization of the fact which once,
and<br>
 never again, was, in painting called Raphael!</p>

<p>The solution of this hard problem is to be found only in
constant<br>
 persevering toil; for, merely to overcome the material
difficulties to<br>
 such an extent, the hand must be so practised, so dexterous
and<br>
 obedient, that the sculptor may be free to struggle soul to soul
with<br>
 the elusive moral element that he has to transfigure as he
embodies<br>
 it. If Paganini, who uttered his soul through the strings of
his<br>
 violin, spent three days without practising, he lost what he
called<br>
 the <i>stops</i> of his instrument, meaning the sympathy between
the wooden<br>
 frame, the strings, the bow, and himself; if he had lost
this<br>
 alliance, he would have been no more than an ordinary
player.</p>

<p>Perpetual work is the law of art, as it is the law of life,
for art is<br>
 idealized creation. Hence great artists and perfect poets wait
neither<br>
 for commission nor for purchasers. They are constantly
creating--<br>
 to-day, to-morrow, always. The result is the habit of work,
the<br>
 unfailing apprehension of the difficulties which keep them in
close<br>
 intercourse with the Muse and her productive forces. Canova
lived in<br>
 his studio, as Voltaire lived in his study; and so must Homer
and<br>
 Phidias have lived.</p>

<p>While Lisbeth kept Wenceslas Steinbock in thraldom in his
garret, he<br>
 was on the thorny road trodden by all these great men, which
leads to<br>
 the Alpine heights of glory. Then happiness, in the person
of<br>
 Hortense, had reduced the poet to idleness--the normal condition
of<br>
 all artists, since to them idleness is fully occupied. Their joy
is<br>
 such as that of the pasha of a seraglio; they revel with ideas,
they<br>
 get drunk at the founts of intellect. Great artists, such as<br>
 Steinbock, wrapped in reverie, are rightly spoken of as
dreamers.<br>
 They, like opium-eaters, all sink into poverty, whereas if they
had<br>
 been kept up to the mark by the stern demands of life, they
might have<br>
 been great men.</p>

<p><br>
 At the same time, these half-artists are delightful; men like
them and<br>
 cram them with praise; they even seem superior to the true
artists,<br>
 who are taxed with conceit, unsociableness, contempt of the laws
of<br>
 society. This is why: Great men are the slaves of their work.
Their<br>
 indifference to outer things, their devotion to their work,
make<br>
 simpletons regard them as egotists, and they are expected to
wear the<br>
 same garb as the dandy who fulfils the trivial evolutions
called<br>
 social duties. These men want the lions of the Atlas to be
combed and<br>
 scented like a lady's poodle.</p>

<p>These artists, who are too rarely matched to meet their
fellows, fall<br>
 into habits of solitary exclusiveness; they are inexplicable to
the<br>
 majority, which, as we know, consists mostly of fools--of the
envious,<br>
 the ignorant, and the superficial.</p>

<p>Now you may imagine what part a wife should play in the life
of these<br>
 glorious and exceptional beings. She ought to be what, for five
years,<br>
 Lisbeth had been, but with the added offering of love, humble
and<br>
 patient love, always ready and always smiling.</p>

<p>Hortense, enlightened by her anxieties as a mother, and driven
by dire<br>
 necessity, had discovered too late the mistakes she had been<br>
 involuntarily led into by her excessive love. Still, the
worthy<br>
 daughter of her mother, her heart ached at the thought of
worrying<br>
 Wenceslas; she loved her dear poet too much to become his
torturer;<br>
 and she could foresee the hour when beggary awaited her, her
child,<br>
 and her husband.</p>

<p>"Come, come, my child," said Lisbeth, seeing the tears in her
cousin's<br>
 lovely eyes, "you must not despair. A glassful of tears will not
buy a<br>
 plate of soup. How much do you want?"</p>

<p>"Well, five or six thousand francs."</p>

<p>"I have but three thousand at the most," said Lisbeth. "And
what is<br>
 Wenceslas doing now?"</p>

<p>"He has had an offer to work in partnership with Stidmann at a
table<br>
 service for the Duc d'Herouville for six thousand francs.
Then<br>
 Monsieur Chanor will advance four thousand to repay Monsieur de
Lora<br>
 and Bridau--a debt of honor."</p>

<p>"What, you have had the money for the statue and the
bas-reliefs for<br>
 Marshal Montcornet's monument, and you have not paid them
yet?"</p>

<p>"For the last three years," said Hortense, "we have spent
twelve<br>
 thousand francs a year, and I have but a hundred louis a year of
my<br>
 own. The Marshal's monument, when all the expenses were paid,
brought<br>
 us no more than sixteen thousand francs. Really and truly,
if<br>
 Wenceslas gets no work, I do not know what is to become of us.
Oh, if<br>
 only I could learn to make statues, I would handle the clay!"
she<br>
 cried, holding up her fine arms.</p>

<p>The woman, it was plain, fulfilled the promise of the girl;
there was<br>
 a flash in her eye; impetuous blood, strong with iron, flowed in
her<br>
 veins; she felt that she was wasting her energy in carrying
her<br>
 infant.</p>

<p>"Ah, my poor little thing! a sensible girl should not marry an
artist<br>
 till his fortune is made--not while it is still to make."</p>

<p>At this moment they heard voices; Stidmann and Wenceslas were
seeing<br>
 Chanor to the door; then Wenceslas and Stidmann came in
again.</p>

<p>Stidmann, an artist in vogue in the world of journalists,
famous<br>
 actresses, and courtesans of the better class, was a young man
of<br>
 fashion whom Valerie much wished to see in her rooms; indeed, he
had<br>
 already been introduced to her by Claude Vignon. Stidmann had
lately<br>
 broken off an intimacy with Madame Schontz, who had married
some<br>
 months since and gone to live in the country. Valerie and
Lisbeth,<br>
 hearing of this upheaval from Claude Vignon, thought it well to
get<br>
 Steinbock's friend to visit in the Rue Vanneau.</p>

<p>Stidmann, out of good feeling, went rarely to the Steinbocks';
and as<br>
 it happened that Lisbeth was not present when he was introduced
by<br>
 Claude Vignon, she now saw him for the first time. As she
watched this<br>
 noted artist, she caught certain glances from his eyes at
Hortense,<br>
 which suggested to her the possibility of offering him to the
Countess<br>
 Steinbock as a consolation if Wenceslas should be false to her.
In<br>
 point of fact, Stidmann was reflecting that if Steinbock were
not his<br>
 friend, Hortense, the young and superbly beautiful countess,
would be<br>
 an adorable mistress; it was this very notion, controlled by
honor,<br>
 that kept him away from the house. Lisbeth was quick to mark
the<br>
 significant awkwardness that troubles a man in the presence of a
woman<br>
 with whom he will not allow himself to flirt.</p>

<p>"Very good-looking--that young man," said she in a whisper
to<br>
 Hortense.</p>

<p>"Oh, do you think so?" she replied. "I never noticed him."</p>

<p>"Stidmann, my good fellow," said Wenceslas, in an undertone to
his<br>
 friend, "we are on no ceremony, you and I--we have some business
to<br>
 settle with this old girl."</p>

<p>Stidmann bowed to the ladies and went away.</p>

<p>"It is settled," said Wenceslas, when he came in from taking
leave of<br>
 Stidmann. "But there are six months' work to be done, and we
must live<br>
 meanwhile."</p>

<p>"There are my diamonds," cried the young Countess, with the
impetuous<br>
 heroism of a loving woman.</p>

<p>A tear rose in Wenceslas' eye.</p>

<p>"Oh, I am going to work," said he, sitting down by his wife
and<br>
 drawing her on to his knee. "I will do odd jobs--a wedding
chest,<br>
 bronze groups----"</p>

<p>"But, my children," said Lisbeth; "for, as you know, you will
be my<br>
 heirs, and I shall leave you a very comfortable sum, believe
me,<br>
 especially if you help me to marry the Marshal; nay, if we
succeed in<br>
 that quickly, I will take you all to board with me--you and
Adeline.<br>
 We should live very happily together.--But for the moment,
listen to<br>
 the voice of my long experience. Do not fly to the
Mont-de-Piete; it<br>
 is the ruin of the borrower. I have always found that when
the<br>
 interest was due, those who had pledged their things had
nothing<br>
 wherewith to pay up, and then all is lost. I can get you a loan
at<br>
 five per cent on your note of hand."</p>

<p>"Oh, we are saved!" said Hortense.</p>

<p>"Well, then, child, Wenceslas had better come with me to see
the<br>
 lender, who will oblige him at my request. It is Madame
Marneffe. If<br>
 you flatter her a little--for she is as vain as a
<i>parvenue</i>--she will<br>
 get you out of the scrape in the most obliging way. Come
yourself and<br>
 see her, my dear Hortense."</p>

<p>Hortense looked at her husband with the expression a man
condemned to<br>
 death must wear on his way to the scaffold.</p>

<p>"Claude Vignon took Stidmann there," said Wenceslas. "He says
it is a<br>
 very pleasant house."</p>

<p>Hortense's head fell. What she felt can only be expressed in
one word;<br>
 it was not pain; it was illness.</p>

<p>"But, my dear Hortense, you must learn something of life!"
exclaimed<br>
 Lisbeth, understanding the eloquence of her cousin's looks.<br>
 "Otherwise, like your mother, you will find yourself abandoned
in a<br>
 deserted room, where you will weep like Calypso on the departure
of<br>
 Ulysses, and at an age when there is no hope of Telemachus--"
she<br>
 added, repeating a jest of Madame Marneffe's. "We have to regard
the<br>
 people in the world as tools which we can make use of or let
alone,<br>
 according as they can serve our turn. Make use of Madame
Marneffe now,<br>
 my dears, and let her alone by and by. Are you afraid lest
Wenceslas,<br>
 who worships you, should fall in love with a woman four or five
years<br>
 older than himself, as yellow as a bundle of field peas,
and----?"</p>

<p>"I would far rather pawn my diamonds," said Hortense. "Oh,
never go<br>
 there, Wenceslas!--It is hell!"</p>

<p>"Hortense is right," said Steinbock, kissing his wife.</p>

<p>"Thank you, my dearest," said Hortense, delighted. "My husband
is an<br>
 angel, you see, Lisbeth. He does not gamble, he goes nowhere
without<br>
 me; if he only could stick to work--oh, I should be too happy.
Why<br>
 take us on show to my father's mistress, a woman who is ruining
him<br>
 and is the cause of troubles that are killing my heroic
mother?"</p>

<p>"My child, that is not where the cause of your father's ruin
lies. It<br>
 was his singer who ruined him, and then your marriage!" replied
her<br>
 cousin. "Bless me! why, Madame Marneffe is of the greatest use
to him.<br>
 However, I must tell no tales."</p>

<p>"You have a good word for everybody, dear Betty--"</p>

<p>Hortense was called into the garden by hearing the child cry;
Lisbeth<br>
 was left alone with Wenceslas.</p>

<p>"You have an angel for your wife, Wenceslas!" said she. "Love
her as<br>
 you ought; never give her cause for grief."</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed, I love her so well that I do not tell her all,"
replied<br>
 Wenceslas; "but to you, Lisbeth, I may confess the truth.--If I
took<br>
 my wife's diamonds to the Monte-de-Piete, we should be no
further<br>
 forward."</p>

<p>"Then borrow of Madame Marneffe," said Lisbeth. "Persuade
Hortense,<br>
 Wenceslas, to let you go there, or else, bless me! go there
without<br>
 telling her."</p>

<p>"That is what I was thinking of," replied Wenceslas, "when I
refused<br>
 for fear of grieving Hortense."</p>

<p>"Listen to me; I care too much for you both not to warn you of
your<br>
 danger. If you go there, hold your heart tight in both hands,
for the<br>
 woman is a witch. All who see her adore her; she is so wicked,
so<br>
 inviting! She fascinates men like a masterpiece. Borrow her
money, but<br>
 do not leave your soul in pledge. I should never be happy again
if you<br>
 were false to Hortense--here she is! not another word! I will
settle<br>
 the matter."</p>

<p>"Kiss Lisbeth, my darling," said Wenceslas to his wife. "She
will help<br>
 us out of our difficulties by lending us her savings."</p>

<p>And he gave Lisbeth a look which she understood.</p>

<p>"Then, I hope you mean to work, my dear treasure," said
Hortense.</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed," said the artist. "I will begin to-morrow."</p>

<p>"To-morrow is our ruin!" said his wife, with a smile.</p>

<p>"Now, my dear child! say yourself whether some hindrance has
not come<br>
 in the way every day; some obstacle or business?"</p>

<p>"Yes, very true, my love."</p>

<p>"Here!" cried Steinbock, striking his brow, "here I have
swarms of<br>
 ideas! I mean to astonish all my enemies. I am going to design
a<br>
 service in the German style of the sixteenth century; the
romantic<br>
 style: foliage twined with insects, sleeping children, newly
invented<br>
 monsters, chimeras--real chimeras, such as we dream of!--I see
it all!<br>
 It will be undercut, light, and yet crowded. Chanor was quite
amazed.<br>
 --And I wanted some encouragement, for the last article on<br>
 Montcornet's monument had been crushing."</p>

<p>At a moment in the course of the day when Lisbeth and
Wenceslas were<br>
 left together, the artist agreed to go on the morrow to see
Madame<br>
 Marneffe--he either would win his wife's consent, or he would
go<br>
 without telling her.</p>

<p>Valerie, informed the same evening of this success, insisted
that<br>
 Hulot should go to invite Stidmann, Claude Vignon, and Steinbock
to<br>
 dinner; for she was beginning to tyrannize over him as women of
that<br>
 type tyrannize over old men, who trot round town, and go to
make<br>
 interest with every one who is necessary to the interests or
the<br>
 vanity of their task-mistress.</p>

<p>Next evening Valerie armed herself for conquest by making such
a<br>
 toilet as a Frenchwoman can devise when she wishes to make the
most of<br>
 herself. She studied her appearance in this great work as a man
going<br>
 out to fight a duel practises his feints and lunges. Not a
speck, not<br>
 a wrinkle was to be seen. Valerie was at her whitest, her
softest, her<br>
 sweetest. And certain little "patches" attracted the eye.</p>

<p>It is commonly supposed that the patch of the eighteenth
century is<br>
 out of date or out of fashion; that is a mistake. In these days
women,<br>
 more ingenious perhaps than of yore, invite a glance through
the<br>
 opera-glass by other audacious devices. One is the first to hit
on a<br>
 rosette in her hair with a diamond in the centre, and she
attracts<br>
 every eye for a whole evening; another revives the hair-net, or
sticks<br>
 a dagger through the twist to suggest a garter; this one wears
velvet<br>
 bands round her wrists, that one appears in lace lippets.
These<br>
 valiant efforts, an Austerlitz of vanity or of love, then set
the<br>
 fashion for lower spheres by the time the inventive creatress
has<br>
 originated something new. This evening, which Valerie meant to
be a<br>
 success for her, she had placed three patches. She had washed
her hair<br>
 with some lye, which changed its hue for a few days from a gold
color<br>
 to a duller shade. Madame Steinbock's was almost red, and she
would be<br>
 in every point unlike her. This new effect gave her a piquant
and<br>
 strange appearance, which puzzled her followers so much, that
Montes<br>
 asked her:</p>

<p>"What have you done to yourself this evening?"--Then she put
on a<br>
 rather wide black velvet neck-ribbon, which showed off the
whiteness<br>
 of her skin. One patch took the place of the <i>assassine</i> of
our<br>
 grandmothers. And Valerie pinned the sweetest rosebud into her
bodice,<br>
 just in the middle above the stay-busk, and in the daintiest
little<br>
 hollow! It was enough to make every man under thirty drop his
eyelids.</p>

<p>"I am as sweet as a sugar-plum," said she to herself, going
through<br>
 her attitudes before the glass, exactly as a dancer practises
her<br>
 curtesies.</p>

<p>Lisbeth had been to market, and the dinner was to be one of
those<br>
 superfine meals which Mathurine had been wont to cook for her
Bishop<br>
 when he entertained the prelate of the adjoining diocese.</p>

<p>Stidmann, Claude Vignon, and Count Steinbock arrived almost
together,<br>
 just at six. An ordinary, or, if you will, a natural woman would
have<br>
 hastened at the announcement of a name so eagerly longed for;
but<br>
 Valerie, though ready since five o'clock, remained in her
room,<br>
 leaving her three guests together, certain that she was the
subject of<br>
 their conversation or of their secret thoughts. She herself
had<br>
 arranged the drawing-room, laying out the pretty trifles
produced in<br>
 Paris and nowhere else, which reveal the woman and announce
her<br>
 presence: albums bound in enamel or embroidered with beads,
saucers<br>
 full of pretty rings, marvels of Sevres or Dresden mounted
exquisitely<br>
 by Florent and Chanor, statues, books, all the frivolities which
cost<br>
 insane sums, and which passion orders of the makers in its
first<br>
 delirium--or to patch up its last quarrel.</p>

<p>Besides, Valerie was in the state of intoxication that comes
of<br>
 triumph. She had promised to marry Crevel if Marneffe should
die; and<br>
 the amorous Crevel had transferred to the name of Valerie Fortin
bonds<br>
 bearing ten thousand francs a year, the sum-total of what he had
made<br>
 in railway speculations during the past three years, the returns
on<br>
 the capital of a hundred thousand crowns which he had at first
offered<br>
 to the Baronne Hulot. So Valerie now had an income of
thirty-two<br>
 thousand francs.</p>

<p>Crevel had just committed himself to a promise of far
greater<br>
 magnitude than this gift of his surplus. In the paroxysm of
rapture<br>
 which <i>his Duchess</i> had given him from two to four--he gave
this fine<br>
 title to Madame <i>de</i> Marneffe to complete the illusion--for
Valerie<br>
 had surpassed herself in the Rue du Dauphin that afternoon, he
had<br>
 thought well to encourage her in her promised fidelity by giving
her<br>
 the prospect of a certain little mansion, built in the Rue
Barbette by<br>
 an imprudent contractor, who now wanted to sell it. Valerie
could<br>
 already see herself in this delightful residence, with a
fore-court<br>
 and a garden, and keeping a carriage!</p>

<p><br>
 "What respectable life can ever procure so much in so short a
time, or<br>
 so easily?" said she to Lisbeth as she finished dressing.
Lisbeth was<br>
 to dine with Valerie that evening, to tell Steinbock those
things<br>
 about the lady which nobody can say about herself.</p>

<p>Madame Marneffe, radiant with satisfaction, came into the
drawing-room<br>
 with modest grace, followed by Lisbeth dressed in black and
yellow to<br>
 set her off.</p>

<p>"Good-evening, Claude," said she, giving her hand to the
famous old<br>
 critic.</p>

<p>Claude Vignon, like many another, had become a political
personage--a<br>
 word describing an ambitious man at the first stage of his
career. The<br>
 <i>political personage</i> of 1840 represents, in some degree,
the <i>Abbe</i><br>
 of the eighteenth century. No drawing-room circle is complete
without<br>
 one.</p>

<p>"My dear, this is my cousin, Count Steinbock," said
Lisbeth,<br>
 introducing Wenceslas, whom Valerie seemed to have
overlooked.</p>

<p>"Oh yes, I recognized Monsieur le Comte," replied Valerie with
a<br>
 gracious bow to the artist. "I often saw you in the Rue du
Doyenne,<br>
 and I had the pleasure of being present at your wedding.--It
would be<br>
 difficult, my dear," said she to Lisbeth, "to forget your
adopted son<br>
 after once seeing him.--It is most kind of you, Monsieur
Stidmann,"<br>
 she went on, "to have accepted my invitation at such short
notice; but<br>
 necessity knows no law. I knew you to be the friend of both
these<br>
 gentlemen. Nothing is more dreary, more sulky, than a dinner
where all<br>
 the guests are strangers, so it was for their sake that I hailed
you<br>
 in--but you will come another time for mine, I hope?--Say that
you<br>
 will."</p>

<p>And for a few minutes she moved about the room with Stidmann,
wholly<br>
 occupied with him.</p>

<p>Crevel and Hulot were announced separately, and then a deputy
named<br>
 Beauvisage.</p>

<p>This individual, a provincial Crevel, one of the men created
to make<br>
 up the crowd in the world, voted under the banner of Giraud, a
State<br>
 Councillor, and Victorin Hulot. These two politicians were
trying to<br>
 form a nucleus of progressives in the loose array of the
Conservative<br>
 Party. Giraud himself occasionally spent the evening at
Madame<br>
 Marneffe's, and she flattered herself that she should also
capture<br>
 Victorin Hulot; but the puritanical lawyer had hitherto found
excuses<br>
 for refusing to accompany his father and father-in-law. It
seemed to<br>
 him criminal to be seen in the house of the woman who cost his
mother<br>
 so many tears. Victorin Hulot was to the puritans of political
life<br>
 what a pious woman is among bigots.</p>

<p>Beauvisage, formerly a stocking manufacturer at Arcis, was
anxious to<br>
 <i>pick up the Paris style</i>. This man, one of the outer
stones of the<br>
 Chamber, was forming himself under the auspices of this
delicious and<br>
 fascinating Madame Marneffe. Introduced here by Crevel, he
had<br>
 accepted him, at her instigation, as his model and master.
He<br>
 consulted him on every point, took the address of his tailor,
imitated<br>
 him, and tried to strike the same attitudes. In short, Crevel
was his<br>
 Great Man.</p>

<p>Valerie, surrounded by these bigwigs and the three artists,
and<br>
 supported by Lisbeth, struck Wenceslas as a really superior
woman, all<br>
 the more so because Claude Vignon spoke of her like a man in
love.</p>

<p>"She is Madame de Maintenon in Ninon's petticoats!" said the
veteran<br>
 critic. "You may please her in an evening if you have the wit;
but as<br>
 for making her love you--that would be a triumph to crown a
man's<br>
 ambition and fill up his life."</p>

<p>Valerie, while seeming cold and heedless of her former
neighbor,<br>
 piqued his vanity, quite unconsciously indeed, for she knew
nothing of<br>
 the Polish character. There is in the Slav a childish element,
as<br>
 there is in all these primitively wild nations which have
overflowed<br>
 into civilization rather than that they have become civilized.
The<br>
 race has spread like an inundation, and has covered a large
portion of<br>
 the globe. It inhabits deserts whose extent is so vast that it
expands<br>
 at its ease; there is no jostling there, as there is in Europe,
and<br>
 civilization is impossible without the constant friction of
minds and<br>
 interests. The Ukraine, Russia, the plains by the Danube, in
short,<br>
 the Slav nations, are a connecting link between Europe and
Asia,<br>
 between civilization and barbarism. Thus the Pole, the
wealthiest<br>
 member of the Slav family, has in his character all the
childishness<br>
 and inconsistency of a beardless race. He has courage, spirit,
and<br>
 strength; but, cursed with instability, that courage, strength,
and<br>
 energy have neither method nor guidance; for the Pole displays
a<br>
 variability resembling that of the winds which blow across that
vast<br>
 plain broken with swamps; and though he has the impetuosity of
the<br>
 snow squalls that wrench and sweep away buildings, like those
aerial<br>
 avalanches he is lost in the first pool and melts into water.
Man<br>
 always assimilates something from the surroundings in which he
lives.<br>
 Perpetually at strife with the Turk, the Pole has imbibed a
taste for<br>
 Oriental splendor; he often sacrifices what is needful for the
sake of<br>
 display. The men dress themselves out like women, yet the
climate has<br>
 given them the tough constitution of Arabs.</p>

<p>The Pole, sublime in suffering, has tired his oppressors' arms
by<br>
 sheer endurance of beating; and, in the nineteenth century,
has<br>
 reproduced the spectacle presented by the early Christians.
Infuse<br>
 only ten per cent of English cautiousness into the frank and
open<br>
 Polish nature, and the magnanimous white eagle would at this day
be<br>
 supreme wherever the two-headed eagle has sneaked in. A
little<br>
 Machiavelism would have hindered Poland from helping to save
Austria,<br>
 who has taken a share of it; from borrowing from Prussia, the
usurer<br>
 who had undermined it; and from breaking up as soon as a
division was<br>
 first made.</p>

<p>At the christening of Poland, no doubt, the Fairy
Carabosse,<br>
 overlooked by the genii who endowed that attractive people with
the<br>
 most brilliant gifts, came in to say:</p>

<p>"Keep all the gifts that my sisters have bestowed on you; but
you<br>
 shall never know what you wish for!"</p>

<p>If, in its heroic duel with Russia, Poland had won the day,
the Poles<br>
 would now be fighting among themselves, as they formerly fought
in<br>
 their Diets to hinder each other from being chosen King. When
that<br>
 nation, composed entirely of hot-headed dare-devils, has good
sense<br>
 enough to seek a Louis XI. among her own offspring, to accept
his<br>
 despotism and a dynasty, she will be saved.</p>

<p>What Poland has been politically, almost every Pole is in
private<br>
 life, especially under the stress of disaster. Thus
Wenceslas<br>
 Steinbock, after worshiping his wife for three years and knowing
that<br>
 he was a god to her, was so much nettled at finding himself
barely<br>
 noticed by Madame Marneffe, that he made it a point of honor
to<br>
 attract her attention. He compared Valerie with his wife and
gave her<br>
 the palm. Hortense was beautiful flesh, as Valerie had said
to<br>
 Lisbeth; but Madame Marneffe had spirit in her very shape, and
the<br>
 savor of vice.</p>

<p>Such devotion as Hortense's is a feeling which a husband takes
as his<br>
 due; the sense of the immense preciousness of such perfect love
soon<br>
 wears off, as a debtor, in the course of time, begins to fancy
that<br>
 the borrowed money is his own. This noble loyalty becomes the
daily<br>
 bread of the soul, and an infidelity is as tempting as a dainty.
The<br>
 woman who is scornful, and yet more the woman who is reputed<br>
 dangerous, excites curiosity, as spices add flavor to good
food.<br>
 Indeed, the disdain so cleverly acted by Valerie was a novelty
to<br>
 Wenceslas, after three years of too easy enjoyment. Hortense was
a<br>
 wife; Valerie a mistress.</p>

<p>Many men desire to have two editions of the same work, though
it is in<br>
 fact a proof of inferiority when a man cannot make his mistress
of his<br>
 wife. Variety in this particular is a sign of weakness.
Constancy will<br>
 always be the real genius of love, the evidence of immense
power--the<br>
 power that makes the poet! A man ought to find every woman in
his<br>
 wife, as the squalid poets of the seventeenth century made
their<br>
 Manons figure as Iris and Chloe.</p>

<p>"Well," said Lisbeth to the Pole, as she beheld him
fascinated, "what<br>
 do you think of Valerie?"</p>

<p>"She is too charming," replied Wenceslas.</p>

<p>"You would not listen to me," said Betty. "Oh! my little
Wenceslas, if<br>
 you and I had never parted, you would have been that siren's
lover;<br>
 you might have married her when she was a widow, and you would
have<br>
 had her forty thousand francs a year----"</p>

<p>"Really?"</p>

<p>"Certainly," replied Lisbeth. "Now, take care of yourself; I
warned<br>
 you of the danger; do not singe your wings in the candle!--Come,
give<br>
 me your arm, dinner is served."</p>

<p>No language could be so thoroughly demoralizing as this; for
if you<br>
 show a Pole a precipice, he is bound to leap it. As a nation
they have<br>
 the very spirit of cavalry; they fancy they can ride down
every<br>
 obstacle and come out victorious. The spur applied by Lisbeth
to<br>
 Steinbock's vanity was intensified by the appearance of the
dining-<br>
 room, bright with handsome silver plate; the dinner was served
with<br>
 every refinement and extravagance of Parisian luxury.</p>

<p>"I should have done better to take Celimene," thought he to
himself.</p>

<p>All through the dinner Hulot was charming; pleased to see his
son-in-<br>
 law at that table, and yet more happy in the prospect of a<br>
 reconciliation with Valerie, whose fidelity he proposed to
secure by<br>
 the promise of Coquet's head-clerkship. Stidmann responded to
the<br>
 Baron's amiability by shafts of Parisian banter and an artist's
high<br>
 spirits. Steinbock would not allow himself to be eclipsed by
his<br>
 friend; he too was witty, said amusing things, made his mark,
and was<br>
 pleased with himself; Madame Marneffe smiled at him several
times to<br>
 show that she quite understood him.</p>

<p>The good meal and heady wines completed the work; Wenceslas
was deep<br>
 in what must be called the slough of dissipation. Excited by
just a<br>
 glass too much, he stretched himself on a settee after dinner,
sunk in<br>
 physical and mental ecstasy, which Madame Marneffe wrought to
the<br>
 highest pitch by coming to sit down by him--airy, scented,
pretty<br>
 enough to damn an angel. She bent over Wenceslas and almost
touched<br>
 his ear as she whispered to him:</p>

<p>"We cannot talk over business matters this evening, unless you
will<br>
 remain till the last. Between us--you, Lisbeth, and me--we can
settle<br>
 everything to suit you."</p>

<p>"Ah, Madame, you are an angel!" replied Wenceslas, also in a
murmur.<br>
 "I was a pretty fool not to listen to Lisbeth--"</p>

<p>"What did she say?"</p>

<p>"She declared, in the Rue du Doyenne, that you loved me!"</p>

<p>Madame Marneffe looked at him, seemed covered with confusion,
and<br>
 hastily left her seat. A young and pretty woman never rouses the
hope<br>
 of immediate success with impunity. This retreat, the impulse of
a<br>
 virtuous woman who is crushing a passion in the depths of her
heart,<br>
 was a thousand times more effective than the most reckless
avowal.<br>
 Desire was so thoroughly aroused in Wenceslas that he doubled
his<br>
 attentions to Valerie. A woman seen by all is a woman wished
for.<br>
 Hence the terrible power of actresses. Madame Marneffe, knowing
that<br>
 she was watched, behaved like an admired actress. She was
quite<br>
 charming, and her success was immense.</p>

<p>"I no longer wonder at my father-in-law's follies," said
Steinbock to<br>
 Lisbeth.</p>

<p>"If you say such things, Wenceslas, I shall to my dying day
repent of<br>
 having got you the loan of these ten thousand francs. Are you,
like<br>
 all these men," and she indicated the guests, "madly in love
with that<br>
 creature? Remember, you would be your father-in-law's rival. And
think<br>
 of the misery you would bring on Hortense."</p>

<p>"That is true," said Wenceslas. "Hortense is an angel; I
should be a<br>
 wretch."</p>

<p>"And one is enough in the family!" said Lisbeth.</p>

<p>"Artists ought never to marry!" exclaimed Steinbock.</p>

<p>"Ah! that is what I always told you in the Rue du Doyenne.
Your<br>
 groups, your statues, your great works, ought to be your
children."</p>

<p>"What are you talking about?" Valerie asked, joining
Lisbeth.--"Give<br>
 us tea, Cousin."</p>

<p>Steinbock, with Polish vainglory, wanted to appear familiar
with this<br>
 drawing-room fairy. After defying Stidmann, Vignon, and Crevel
with a<br>
 look, he took Valerie's hand and forced her to sit down by him
on the<br>
 settee.</p>

<p>"You are rather too lordly, Count Steinbock," said she,
resisting a<br>
 little. But she laughed as she dropped on to the seat, not
without<br>
 arranging the rosebud pinned into her bodice.</p>

<p>"Alas! if I were really lordly," said he, "I should not be
here to<br>
 borrow money."</p>

<p>"Poor boy! I remember how you worked all night in the Rue du
Doyenne.<br>
 You really were rather a spooney; you married as a starving
man<br>
 snatches a loaf. You knew nothing of Paris, and you see where
you are<br>
 landed. But you turned a deaf ear to Lisbeth's devotion, as you
did to<br>
 the love of a woman who knows her Paris by heart."</p>

<p>"Say no more!" cried Steinbock; "I am done for!"</p>

<p>"You shall have your ten thousand francs, my dear Wenceslas;
but on<br>
 one condition," she went on, playing with his handsome
curls.</p>

<p>"What is that?"</p>

<p>"I will take no interest----"</p>

<p>"Madame!"</p>

<p>"Oh, you need not be indignant; you shall make it good by
giving me a<br>
 bronze group. You began the story of Samson; finish it.--Do a
Delilah<br>
 cutting off the Jewish Hercules' hair. And you, who, if you
will<br>
 listen to me, will be a great artist, must enter into the
subject.<br>
 What you have to show is the power of woman. Samson is a
secondary<br>
 consideration. He is the corpse of dead strength. It is
Delilah--<br>
 passion--that ruins everything. How far more beautiful is
that<br>
 <i>replica</i>--That is what you call it, I think--" She
skilfully<br>
 interpolated, as Claude Vignon and Stidmann came up to them on
hearing<br>
 her talk of sculpture--"how far more beautiful than the Greek
myth is<br>
 that <i>replica</i> of Hercules at Omphale's feet.--Did Greece
copy Judaea,<br>
 or did Judaea borrow the symbolism from Greece?"</p>

<p>"There, madame, you raise an important question--that of the
date of<br>
 the various writings in the Bible. The great and immortal
Spinoza--<br>
 most foolishly ranked as an atheist, whereas he gave
mathematical<br>
 proof of the existence of God--asserts that the Book of Genesis
and<br>
 all the political history of the Bible are of the time of Moses,
and<br>
 he demonstrates the interpolated passages by philological
evidence.<br>
 And he was thrice stabbed as he went into the synagogue."</p>

<p>"I had no idea I was so learned," said Valerie, annoyed at
this<br>
 interruption to her <i>tete-a-tete.</i></p>

<p>"Women know everything by instinct," replied Claude
Vignon.</p>

<p>"Well, then, you promise me?" she said to Steinbock, taking
his hand<br>
 with the timidity of a girl in love.</p>

<p>"You are indeed a happy man, my dear fellow," cried Stidmann,
"if<br>
 madame asks a favor of you!"</p>

<p>"What is it?" asked Claude Vignon.</p>

<p>"A small bronze group," replied Steinbock, "Delilah cutting
off<br>
 Samson's hair."</p>

<p>"It is difficult," remarked Vignon. "A bed----"</p>

<p>"On the contrary, it is exceedingly easy," replied Valerie,
smiling.</p>

<p>"Ah ha! teach us sculpture!" said Stidmann.</p>

<p>"You should take madame for your subject," replied Vignon,
with a keen<br>
 glance at Valerie.</p>

<p>"Well," she went on, "this is my notion of the composition.
Samson on<br>
 waking finds he has no hair, like many a dandy with a false
top-knot.<br>
 The hero is sitting on the bed, so you need only show the foot
of it,<br>
 covered with hangings and drapery. There he is, like Marius
among the<br>
 ruins of Carthage, his arms folded, his head shaven--Napoleon
at<br>
 Saint-Helena--what you will! Delilah is on her knees, a good
deal like<br>
 Canova's Magdalen. When a hussy has ruined her man, she adores
him. As<br>
 I see it, the Jewess was afraid of Samson in his strength and
terrors,<br>
 but she must have loved him when she saw him a child again. So
Delilah<br>
 is bewailing her sin, she would like to give her lover his hair
again.<br>
 She hardly dares to look at him; but she does look, with a
smile, for<br>
 she reads forgiveness in Samson's weakness. Such a group as
this, and<br>
 one of the ferocious Judith, would epitomize woman. Virtue cuts
off<br>
 your head; vice only cuts off your hair. Take care of your
wigs,<br>
 gentlemen!"</p>

<p>And she left the artists quite overpowered, to sing her
praises in<br>
 concert with the critic.</p>

<p>"It is impossible to be more bewitching!" cried Stidmann.</p>

<p>"Oh! she is the most intelligent and desirable woman I have
ever met,"<br>
 said Claude Vignon. "Such a combination of beauty and cleverness
is so<br>
 rare."</p>

<p>"And if you who had the honor of being intimate with Camille
Maupin<br>
 can pronounce such a verdict," replied Stidmann, "what are we
to<br>
 think?"</p>

<p>"If you will make your Delilah a portrait of Valerie, my dear
Count,"<br>
 said Crevel, who had risen for a moment from the card-table, and
who<br>
 had heard what had been said, "I will give you a thousand crowns
for<br>
 an example--yes, by the Powers! I will shell out to the tune of
a<br>
 thousand crowns!"</p>

<p>"Shell out! What does that mean?" asked Beauvisage of Claude
Vignon.</p>

<p>"Madame must do me the honor to sit for it then," said
Steinbock to<br>
 Crevel. "Ask her--"</p>

<p>At this moment Valerie herself brought Steinbock a cup of tea.
This<br>
 was more than a compliment, it was a favor. There is a
complete<br>
 language in the manner in which a woman does this little
civility; but<br>
 women are fully aware of the fact, and it is a curious thing to
study<br>
 their movements, their manner, their look, tone, and accent when
they<br>
 perform this apparently simple act of politeness.--From the
question,<br>
 "Do you take tea?"--"Will you have some tea?"--"A cup of tea?"
coldly<br>
 asked, and followed by instructions to the nymph of the urn to
bring<br>
 it, to the eloquent poem of the odalisque coming from the
tea-table,<br>
 cup in hand, towards the pasha of her heart, presenting it<br>
 submissively, offering it in an insinuating voice, with a look
full of<br>
 intoxicating promises, a physiologist could deduce the whole
scale of<br>
 feminine emotion, from aversion or indifference to Phaedra's<br>
 declaration to Hippolytus. Women can make it, at will,
contemptuous to<br>
 the verge of insult, or humble to the expression of Oriental<br>
 servility.</p>

<p><br>
 And Valerie was more than woman; she was the serpent made woman;
she<br>
 crowned her diabolical work by going up to Steinbock, a cup of
tea in<br>
 her hand.</p>

<p>"I will drink as many cups of tea as you will give me," said
the<br>
 artist, murmuring in her ear as he rose, and touching her
fingers with<br>
 his, "to have them given to me thus!"</p>

<p>"What were you saying about sitting?" said she, without
betraying that<br>
 this declaration, so frantically desired, had gone straight to
her<br>
 heart.</p>

<p>"Old Crevel promises me a thousand crowns for a copy of your
group."</p>

<p>"He! a thousand crowns for a bronze group?"</p>

<p>"Yes--if you will sit for Delilah," said Steinbock.</p>

<p>"He will not be there to see, I hope!" replied she. "The group
would<br>
 be worth more than all his fortune, for Delilah's costume is
rather<br>
 un-dressy."</p>

<p>Just as Crevel loved to strike an attitude, every woman has
a<br>
 victorious gesture, a studied movement, which she knows must
win<br>
 admiration. You may see in a drawing-room how one spends all her
time<br>
 looking down at her tucker or pulling up the shoulder-piece of
her<br>
 gown, how another makes play with the brightness of her eyes
by<br>
 glancing up at the cornice. Madame Marneffe's triumph, however,
was<br>
 not face to face like that of other women. She turned sharply
round to<br>
 return to Lisbeth at the tea-table. This ballet-dancer's
pirouette,<br>
 whisking her skirts, by which she had overthrown Hulot, now
fascinated<br>
 Steinbock.</p>

<p>"Your vengeance is secure," said Valerie to Lisbeth in a
whisper.<br>
 "Hortense will cry out all her tears, and curse the day when
she<br>
 robbed you of Wenceslas."</p>

<p>"Till I am Madame la Marechale I shall not think myself
successful,"<br>
 replied the cousin; "but they are all beginning to wish for
it.--This<br>
 morning I went to Victorin's--I forgot to tell you.--The young
Hulots<br>
 have bought up their father's notes of hand given to Vauvinet,
and<br>
 to-morrow they will endorse a bill for seventy-two thousand
francs at<br>
 five per cent, payable in three years, and secured by a mortgage
on<br>
 their house. So the young people are in straits for three years;
they<br>
 can raise no more money on that property. Victorin is
dreadfully<br>
 distressed; he understands his father. And Crevel is capable
of<br>
 refusing to see them; he will be so angry at this piece of
self-<br>
 sacrifice."</p>

<p>"The Baron cannot have a sou now," said Valerie, and she
smiled at<br>
 Hulot.</p>

<p>"I don't see where he can get it. But he will draw his salary
again in<br>
 September."</p>

<p>"And he has his policy of insurance; he has renewed it. Come,
it is<br>
 high time he should get Marneffe promoted. I will drive it home
this<br>
 evening."</p>

<p>"My dear cousin," said Lisbeth to Wenceslas, "go home, I beg.
You are<br>
 quite ridiculous. Your eyes are fixed on Valerie in a way that
is<br>
 enough to compromise her, and her husband is insanely jealous.
Do not<br>
 tread in your father-in-law's footsteps. Go home; I am sure
Hortense<br>
 is sitting up for you."</p>

<p>"Madame Marneffe told me to stay till the last to settle my
little<br>
 business with you and her," replied Wenceslas.</p>

<p>"No, no," said Lisbeth; "I will bring you the ten thousand
francs, for<br>
 her husband has his eye on you. It would be rash to remain.
To-morrow<br>
 at eleven o'clock bring your note of hand; at that hour that
mandarin<br>
 Marneffe is at his office, Valerie is free.--Have you really
asked her<br>
 to sit for your group?--Come up to my rooms first.--Ah! I was
sure of<br>
 it," she added, as she caught the look which Steinbock flashed
at<br>
 Valerie, "I knew you were a profligate in the bud! Well, Valerie
is<br>
 lovely--but try not to bring trouble on Hortense."</p>

<p>Nothing annoys a married man so much as finding his wife
perpetually<br>
 interposing between himself and his wishes, however
transient.</p>

<p>Wenceslas got home at about one in the morning; Hortense had
expected<br>
 him ever since half-past nine. From half-past nine till ten she
had<br>
 listened to the passing carriages, telling herself that never
before<br>
 had her husband come in so late from dining with Florent and
Chanor.<br>
 She sat sewing by the child's cot, for she had begun to save
a<br>
 needlewoman's pay for the day by doing the mending
herself.--From ten<br>
 till half-past, a suspicion crossed her mind; she sat
wondering:</p>

<p>"Is he really gone to dinner, as he told me, with Chanor and
Florent?<br>
 He put on his best cravat and his handsomest pin when he
dressed. He<br>
 took as long over his toilet as a woman when she wants to make
the<br>
 best of herself.--I am crazy! He loves me!--And here he is!"</p>

<p>But instead of stopping, the cab she heard went past.</p>

<p>From eleven till midnight Hortense was a victim to terrible
alarms;<br>
 the quarter where they lived was now deserted.</p>

<p>"If he has set out on foot, some accident may have happened,"
thought<br>
 she. "A man may be killed by tumbling over a curbstone or
failing to<br>
 see a gap. Artists are so heedless! Or if he should have been
stopped<br>
 by robbers!--It is the first time he has ever left me alone here
for<br>
 six hours and a half!--But why should I worry myself? He cares
for no<br>
 one but me."</p>

<p>Men ought to be faithful to the wives who love them, were it
only on<br>
 account of the perpetual miracles wrought by true love in the
sublime<br>
 regions of the spiritual world. The woman who loves is, in
relation to<br>
 the man she loves, in the position of a somnambulist to whom
the<br>
 magnetizer should give the painful power, when she ceases to be
the<br>
 mirror of the world, of being conscious as a woman of what she
has<br>
 seen as a somnambulist. Passion raises the nervous tension of a
woman<br>
 to the ecstatic pitch at which presentiment is as acute as the
insight<br>
 of a clairvoyant. A wife knows she is betrayed; she will not
let<br>
 herself say so, she doubts still--she loves so much! She gives
the lie<br>
 to the outcry of her own Pythian power. This paroxysm of love
deserves<br>
 a special form of worship.</p>

<p>In noble souls, admiration of this divine phenomenon will
always be a<br>
 safeguard to protect them from infidelity. How should a man
not<br>
 worship a beautiful and intellectual creature whose soul can
soar to<br>
 such manifestations?</p>

<p>By one in the morning Hortense was in a state of such intense
anguish,<br>
 that she flew to the door as she recognized her husband's ring
at the<br>
 bell, and clasped him in her arms like a mother.</p>

<p>"At last--here you are!" cried she, finding her voice again.
"My<br>
 dearest, henceforth where you go I go, for I cannot again endure
the<br>
 torture of such waiting.--I pictured you stumbling over a
curbstone,<br>
 with a fractured skull! Killed by thieves!--No, a second time I
know I<br>
 should go mad.--Have you enjoyed yourself so much?--And without
me!--<br>
 Bad boy!"</p>

<p>"What can I say, my darling? There was Bixiou, who drew
fresh<br>
 caricatures for us; Leon de Lora, as witty as ever; Claude
Vignon, to<br>
 whom I owe the only consolatory article that has come out about
the<br>
 Montcornet statue. There were--"</p>

<p>"Were there no ladies?" Hortense eagerly inquired.</p>

<p>"Worthy Madame Florent--"</p>

<p>"You said the Rocher de Cancale.--Were you at the
Florents'?"</p>

<p>"Yes, at their house; I made a mistake."</p>

<p>"You did not take a coach to come home?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"And you have walked from the Rue des Tournelles?"</p>

<p>"Stidmann and Bixiou came back with me along the boulevards as
far as<br>
 the Madeleine, talking all the way."</p>

<p>"It is dry then on the boulevards and the Place de la Concorde
and the<br>
 Rue de Bourgogne? You are not muddy at all!" said Hortense,
looking at<br>
 her husband's patent leather boots.</p>

<p>It had been raining, but between the Rue Vanneau and the Rue
Saint-<br>
 Dominique Wenceslas had not got his boots soiled.</p>

<p>"Here--here are five thousand francs Chanor has been so
generous as to<br>
 lend me," said Wenceslas, to cut short this lawyer-like
examination.</p>

<p>He had made a division of the ten thousand-franc notes, half
for<br>
 Hortense and half for himself, for he had five thousand francs'
worth<br>
 of debts of which Hortense knew nothing. He owed money to his
foreman<br>
 and his workmen.</p>

<p>"Now your anxieties are relieved," said he, kissing his wife.
"I am<br>
 going to work to-morrow morning. So I am going to bed this
minute to<br>
 get up early, by your leave, my pet."</p>

<p>The suspicion that had dawned in Hortense's mind vanished; she
was<br>
 miles away from the truth. Madame Marneffe! She had never
thought of<br>
 her. Her fear for her Wenceslas was that he should fall in with
street<br>
 prostitutes. The names of Bixiou and Leon de Lora, two artists
noted<br>
 for their wild dissipations, had alarmed her.</p>

<p>Next morning she saw Wenceslas go out at nine o'clock, and was
quite<br>
 reassured.</p>

<p>"Now he is at work again," said she to herself, as she
proceeded to<br>
 dress her boy. "I see he is quite in the vein! Well, well, if
we<br>
 cannot have the glory of Michael Angelo, we may have that of
Benvenuto<br>
 Cellini!"</p>

<p>Lulled by her own hopes, Hortense believed in a happy future;
and she<br>
 was chattering to her son of twenty months in the language
of<br>
 onomatopoeia that amuses babes when, at about eleven o'clock,
the<br>
 cook, who had not seen Wenceslas go out, showed in Stidmann.</p>

<p>"I beg pardon, madame," said he. "Is Wenceslas gone out
already?"</p>

<p>"He is at the studio."</p>

<p>"I came to talk over the work with him."</p>

<p>"I will send for him," said Hortense, offering Stidmann a
chair.</p>

<p>Thanking Heaven for this piece of luck, Hortense was glad to
detain<br>
 Stidmann to ask some questions about the evening before.
Stidmann<br>
 bowed in acknowledgment of her kindness. The Countess Steinbock
rang;<br>
 the cook appeared, and was desired to go at once and fetch her
master<br>
 from the studio.</p>

<p>"You had an amusing dinner last night?" said Hortense.
"Wenceslas did<br>
 not come in till past one in the morning."</p>

<p>"Amusing? not exactly," replied the artist, who had intended
to<br>
 fascinate Madame Marneffe. "Society is not very amusing unless
one is<br>
 interested in it. That little Madame Marneffe is clever, but a
great<br>
 flirt."</p>

<p>"And what did Wenceslas think of her?" asked poor Hortense,
trying to<br>
 keep calm. "He said nothing about her to me."</p>

<p>"I will only say one thing," said Stidmann, "and that is, that
I think<br>
 her a very dangerous woman."</p>

<p>Hortense turned as pale as a woman after childbirth.</p>

<p>"So--it was at--at Madame Marneffe's that you dined--and
not--not with<br>
 Chanor?" said she, "yesterday--and Wenceslas--and he----"</p>

<p>Stidmann, without knowing what mischief he had done, saw that
he had<br>
 blundered.</p>

<p>The Countess did not finish her sentence; she simply fainted
away. The<br>
 artist rang, and the maid came in. When Louise tried to get
her<br>
 mistress into her bedroom, a serious nervous attack came on,
with<br>
 violent hysterics. Stidmann, like any man who by an
involuntary<br>
 indiscretion has overthrown the structure built on a husband's
lie to<br>
 his wife, could not conceive that his words should produce such
an<br>
 effect; he supposed that the Countess was in such delicate
health that<br>
 the slightest contradiction was mischievous.</p>

<p>The cook presently returned to say, unfortunately in loud
tones, that<br>
 her master was not in the studio. In the midst of her
anguish,<br>
 Hortense heard, and the hysterical fit came on again.</p>

<p>"Go and fetch madame's mother," said Louise to the cook.
"Quick--run!"</p>

<p>"If I knew where to find Steinbock, I would go and fetch
him!"<br>
 exclaimed Stidmann in despair.</p>

<p>"He is with that woman!" cried the unhappy wife. "He was not
dressed<br>
 to go to his work!"</p>

<p>Stidmann hurried off to Madame Marneffe's, struck by the truth
of this<br>
 conclusion, due to the second-sight of passion.</p>

<p>At that moment Valerie was posed as Delilah. Stidmann, too
sharp to<br>
 ask for Madame Marneffe, walked straight in past the lodge, and
ran<br>
 quickly up to the second floor, arguing thus: "If I ask for
Madame<br>
 Marneffe, she will be out. If I inquire point-blank for
Steinbock, I<br>
 shall be laughed at to my face.--Take the bull by the
horns!"</p>

<p>Reine appeared in answer to his ring.</p>

<p>"Tell Monsieur le Comte Steinbock to come at once, his wife
is<br>
 dying--"</p>

<p>Reine, quite a match for Stidmann, looked at him with blank
surprise.</p>

<p>"But, sir--I don't know--did you suppose----"</p>

<p>"I tell you that my friend Monsieur Steinbock is here; his
wife is<br>
 very ill. It is quite serious enough for you to disturb your<br>
 mistress." And Stidmann turned on his heel.</p>

<p>"He is there, sure enough!" said he to himself.</p>

<p>And in point of fact, after waiting a few minutes in the Rue
Vanneau,<br>
 he saw Wenceslas come out, and beckoned to him to come quickly.
After<br>
 telling him of the tragedy enacted in the Rue
Saint-Dominique,<br>
 Stidmann scolded Steinbock for not having warned him to keep
the<br>
 secret of yesterday's dinner.</p>

<p>"I am done for," said Wenceslas, "but you are forgiven. I had
totally<br>
 forgotten that you were to call this morning, and I blundered in
not<br>
 telling you that we were to have dined with Florent.--What can I
say?<br>
 That Valerie has turned my head; but, my dear fellow, for her
glory is<br>
 well lost, misfortune well won! She really is!--Good
Heavens!--But I<br>
 am in a dreadful fix. Advise me. What can I say? How can I
excuse<br>
 myself?"</p>

<p>"I! advise you! I don't know," replied Stidmann. "But your
wife loves<br>
 you, I imagine? Well, then, she will believe anything. Tell her
that<br>
 you were on your way to me when I was on my way to you; that, at
any<br>
 rate, will set this morning's business right. Good-bye."</p>

<p>Lisbeth, called down by Reine, ran after Wenceslas and caught
him up<br>
 at the corner of the Rue Hillerin-Bertin; she was afraid of his
Polish<br>
 artlessness. Not wishing to be involved in the matter, she said
a few<br>
 words to Wenceslas, who in his joy hugged her then and there.
She had<br>
 no doubt pushed out a plank to enable the artist to cross this
awkward<br>
 place in his conjugal affairs.</p>

<p>At the sight of her mother, who had flown to her aid, Hortense
burst<br>
 into floods of tears. This happily changed the character of
the<br>
 hysterical attack.</p>

<p>"Treachery, dear mamma!" cried she. "Wenceslas, after giving
me his<br>
 word of honor that he would not go near Madame Marneffe, dined
with<br>
 her last night, and did not come in till a quarter-past one in
the<br>
 morning.--If you only knew! The day before we had had a
discussion,<br>
 not a quarrel, and I had appealed to him so touchingly. I told
him I<br>
 was jealous, that I should die if he were unfaithful; that I
was<br>
 easily suspicious, but that he ought to have some consideration
for my<br>
 weaknesses, as they came of my love for him; that I had my
father's<br>
 blood in my veins as well as yours; that at the first moment of
such<br>
 discovery I should be mad, and capable of mad deeds--of
avenging<br>
 myself--of dishonoring us all, him, his child, and myself; that
I<br>
 might even kill him first and myself after--and so on.</p>

<p><br>
 "And yet he went there; he is there!--That woman is bent on
breaking<br>
 all our hearts! Only yesterday my brother and Celestine pledged
their<br>
 all to pay off seventy thousand francs on notes of hand signed
for<br>
 that good-for-nothing creature.--Yes, mamma, my father would
have been<br>
 arrested and put into prison. Cannot that dreadful woman be
content<br>
 with having my father, and with all your tears? Why take my
Wenceslas?<br>
 --I will go to see her and stab her!"</p>

<p>Madame Hulot, struck to the heart by the dreadful secrets
Hortense was<br>
 unwittingly letting out, controlled her grief by one of the
heroic<br>
 efforts which a magnanimous mother can make, and drew her
daughter's<br>
 head on to her bosom to cover it with kisses.</p>

<p>"Wait for Wenceslas, my child; all will be explained. The evil
cannot<br>
 be so great as you picture it!--I, too, have been deceived, my
dear<br>
 Hortense; you think me handsome, I have lived blameless; and yet
I<br>
 have been utterly forsaken for three-and-twenty years--for a
Jenny<br>
 Cadine, a Josepha, a Madame Marneffe!-- Did you know that?"</p>

<p>"You, mamma, you! You have endured this for twenty----"</p>

<p>She broke off, staggered by her own thoughts.</p>

<p>"Do as I have done, my child," said her mother. "Be gentle and
kind,<br>
 and your conscience will be at peace. On his death-bed a man may
say,<br>
 'My wife has never cost me a pang!' And God, who hears that
dying<br>
 breath, credits it to us. If I had abandoned myself to fury like
you,<br>
 what would have happened? Your father would have been
embittered,<br>
 perhaps he would have left me altogether, and he would not have
been<br>
 withheld by any fear of paining me. Our ruin, utter as it now
is,<br>
 would have been complete ten years sooner, and we should have
shown<br>
 the world the spectacle of a husband and wife living quite
apart--a<br>
 scandal of the most horrible, heart-breaking kind, for it is
the<br>
 destruction of the family. Neither your brother nor you could
have<br>
 married.</p>

<p>"I sacrificed myself, and that so bravely, that, till this
last<br>
 connection of your father's, the world has believed me happy.
My<br>
 serviceable and indeed courageous falsehood has, till now,
screened<br>
 Hector; he is still respected; but this old man's passion is
taking<br>
 him too far, that I see. His own folly, I fear, will break
through the<br>
 veil I have kept between the world and our home. However, I have
held<br>
 that curtain steady for twenty-three years, and have wept behind
it--<br>
 motherless, I, without a friend to trust, with no help but in
religion<br>
 --I have for twenty-three years secured the family
honor----"</p>

<p>Hortense listened with a fixed gaze. The calm tone of
resignation and<br>
 of such crowning sorrow soothed the smart of her first wound;
the<br>
 tears rose again and flowed in torrents. In a frenzy of
filial<br>
 affection, overcome by her mother's noble heroism, she fell on
her<br>
 knees before Adeline, took up the hem of her dress and kissed
it, as<br>
 pious Catholics kiss the holy relics of a martyr.</p>

<p>"Nay, get up, Hortense," said the Baroness. "Such homage from
my<br>
 daughter wipes out many sad memories. Come to my heart, and weep
for<br>
 no sorrows but your own. It is the despair of my dear little
girl,<br>
 whose joy was my only joy, that broke the solemn seal which
nothing<br>
 ought to have removed from my lips. Indeed, I meant to have
taken my<br>
 woes to the tomb, as a shroud the more. It was to soothe your
anguish<br>
 that I spoke.--God will forgive me!</p>

<p>"Oh! if my life were to be your life, what would I not do?
Men, the<br>
 world, Fate, Nature, God Himself, I believe, make us pay for
love with<br>
 the most cruel grief. I must pay for ten years of happiness
and<br>
 twenty-four years of despair, of ceaseless sorrow, of
bitterness--"</p>

<p>"But you had ten years, dear mamma, and I have had but three!"
said<br>
 the self-absorbed girl.</p>

<p>"Nothing is lost yet," said Adeline. "Only wait till Wenceslas
comes."</p>

<p>"Mother," said she, "he lied, he deceived me. He said, 'I will
not<br>
 go,' and he went. And that over his child's cradle."</p>

<p>"For pleasure, my child, men will commit the most cowardly,
the most<br>
 infamous actions--even crimes; it lies in their nature, it would
seem.<br>
 We wives are set apart for sacrifice. I believed my troubles
were<br>
 ended, and they are beginning again, for I never thought to
suffer<br>
 doubly by suffering with my child. Courage--and silence!--My
Hortense,<br>
 swear that you will never discuss your griefs with anybody but
me,<br>
 never let them be suspected by any third person. Oh! be as proud
as<br>
 your mother has been."</p>

<p>Hortense started; she had heard her husband's step.</p>

<p>"So it would seem," said Wenceslas, as he came in, "that
Stidmann has<br>
 been here while I went to see him."</p>

<p>"Indeed!" said Hortense, with the angry irony of an offended
woman who<br>
 uses words to stab.</p>

<p>"Certainly," said Wenceslas, affecting surprise. "We have just
met."</p>

<p>"And yesterday?"</p>

<p>"Well, yesterday I deceived you, my darling love; and your
mother<br>
 shall judge between us."</p>

<p>This candor unlocked his wife's heart. All really lofty women
like the<br>
 truth better than lies. They cannot bear to see their idol
smirched;<br>
 they want to be proud of the despotism they bow to.</p>

<p>There is a strain of this feeling in the devotion of the
Russians to<br>
 their Czar.</p>

<p>"Now, listen, dear mother," Wenceslas went on. "I so truly
love my<br>
 sweet and kind Hortense, that I concealed from her the extent of
our<br>
 poverty. What could I do? She was still nursing the boy, and
such<br>
 troubles would have done her harm; you know what the risk is for
a<br>
 woman. Her beauty, youth, and health are imperiled. Did I do
wrong?--<br>
 She believes that we owe five thousand francs; but I owe five
thousand<br>
 more. The day before yesterday we were in the depths! No one on
earth<br>
 will lend to us artists. Our talents are not less untrustworthy
than<br>
 our whims. I knocked in vain at every door. Lisbeth, indeed,
offered<br>
 us her savings."</p>

<p>"Poor soul!" said Hortense.</p>

<p>"Poor soul!" said the Baroness.</p>

<p>"But what are Lisbeth's two thousand francs? Everything to
her,<br>
 nothing to us.--Then, as you know, Hortense, she spoke to us of
Madame<br>
 Marneffe, who, as she owes so much to the Baron, out of a sense
of<br>
 honor, will take no interest. Hortense wanted to send her
diamonds to<br>
 the Mont-de-Piete; they would have brought in a few thousand
francs,<br>
 but we needed ten thousand. Those ten thousand francs were to be
had<br>
 free of interest for a year!--I said to myself, 'Hortense will
be none<br>
 the wiser; I will go and get them.'</p>

<p>"Then the woman asked me to dinner through my father-in-law,
giving me<br>
 to understand that Lisbeth had spoken of the matter, and I
should have<br>
 the money. Between Hortense's despair on one hand, and the
dinner on<br>
 the other, I could not hesitate.--That is all.</p>

<p>"What! could Hortense, at four-and-twenty, lovely, pure, and
virtuous,<br>
 and all my pride and glory, imagine that, when I have never left
her<br>
 since we married, I could now prefer--what?--a tawny, painted,
ruddled<br>
 creature?" said he, using the vulgar exaggeration of the studio
to<br>
 convince his wife by the vehemence that women like.</p>

<p>"Oh! if only your father had ever spoken so----!" cried the
Baroness.</p>

<p>Hortense threw her arms round her husband's neck.</p>

<p>"Yes, that is what I should have done," said her mother.
"Wenceslas,<br>
 my dear fellow, your wife was near dying of it," she went on
very<br>
 seriously. "You see how well she loves you. And, alas--she is
yours!"</p>

<p>She sighed deeply.</p>

<p>"He may make a martyr of her, or a happy woman," thought she
to<br>
 herself, as every mother thinks when she sees her daughter
married.--<br>
 "It seems to me," she said aloud, "that I am miserable enough to
hope<br>
 to see my children happy."</p>

<p>"Be quite easy, dear mamma," said Wenceslas, only too glad to
see this<br>
 critical moment end happily. "In two months I shall have repaid
that<br>
 dreadful woman. How could I help it," he went on, repeating
this<br>
 essentially Polish excuse with a Pole's grace; "there are times
when a<br>
 man would borrow of the Devil.--And, after all, the money
belongs to<br>
 the family. When once she had invited me, should I have got the
money<br>
 at all if I had responded to her civility with a rude
refusal?"</p>

<p>"Oh, mamma, what mischief papa is bringing on us!" cried
Hortense.</p>

<p>The Baroness laid her finger on her daughter's lips, aggrieved
by this<br>
 complaint, the first blame she had ever uttered of a father
so<br>
 heroically screened by her mother's magnanimous silence.</p>

<p>"Now, good-bye, my children," said Madame Hulot. "The storm is
over.<br>
 But do not quarrel any more."</p>

<p>When Wenceslas and his wife returned to their room after
letting out<br>
 the Baroness, Hortense said to her husband:</p>

<p>"Tell me all about last evening."</p>

<p>And she watched his face all through the narrative,
interrupting him<br>
 by the questions that crowd on a wife's mind in such
circumstances.<br>
 The story made Hortense reflect; she had a glimpse of the
infernal<br>
 dissipation which an artist must find in such vicious
company.</p>

<p>"Be honest, my Wenceslas; Stidmann was there, Claude
Vignon,<br>
 Vernisset.--Who else? In short, it was good fun?"</p>

<p>"I, I was thinking of nothing but our ten thousand francs, and
I was<br>
 saying to myself, 'My Hortense will be freed from anxiety.'
"</p>

<p>This catechism bored the Livonian excessively; he seized a
gayer<br>
 moment to say:</p>

<p>"And you, my dearest, what would you have done if your artist
had<br>
 proved guilty?"</p>

<p>"I," said she, with an air of prompt decision, "I should have
taken up<br>
 Stidmann--not that I love him, of course!"</p>

<p>"Hortense!" cried Steinbock, starting to his feet with a
sudden and<br>
 theatrical emphasis. "You would not have had the chance--I would
have<br>
 killed you!"</p>

<p>Hortense threw herself into his arms, clasping him closely
enough to<br>
 stifle him, and covered him with kisses, saying:</p>

<p>"Ah, you do love me! I fear nothing!--But no more Marneffe.
Never go<br>
 plunging into such horrible bogs."</p>

<p>"I swear to you, my dear Hortense, that I will go there no
more,<br>
 excepting to redeem my note of hand."</p>

<p>She pouted at this, but only as a loving woman sulks to get
something<br>
 for it. Wenceslas, tired out with such a morning's work, went
off to<br>
 his studio to make a clay sketch of the <i>Samson and
Delilah</i>, for<br>
 which he had the drawings in his pocket.</p>

<p>Hortense, penitent for her little temper, and fancying that
her<br>
 husband was annoyed with her, went to the studio just as the
sculptor<br>
 had finished handling the clay with the impetuosity that spurs
an<br>
 artist when the mood is on him. On seeing his wife, Wenceslas
hastily<br>
 threw the wet wrapper over the group, and putting both arms
round her,<br>
 he said:</p>

<p>"We were not really angry, were we, my pretty puss?"</p>

<p>Hortense had caught sight of the group, had seen the linen
thrown over<br>
 it, and had said nothing; but as she was leaving, she took off
the<br>
 rag, looked at the model, and asked:</p>

<p>"What is that?"</p>

<p>"A group for which I had just had an idea."</p>

<p>"And why did you hide it?"</p>

<p>"I did not mean you to see it till it was finished."</p>

<p>"The woman is very pretty," said Hortense.</p>

<p>And a thousand suspicions cropped up in her mind, as, in
India, tall,<br>
 rank plants spring up in a night-time.</p>

<p>By the end of three weeks, Madame Marneffe was intensely
irritated by<br>
 Hortense. Women of that stamp have a pride of their own; they
insist<br>
 that men shall kiss the devil's hoof; they have no forgiveness
for the<br>
 virtue that does not quail before their dominion, or that even
holds<br>
 its own against them. Now, in all that time Wenceslas had not
paid one<br>
 visit in the Rue Vanneau, not even that which politeness
required to a<br>
 woman who had sat for Delilah.</p>

<p>Whenever Lisbeth called on the Steinbocks, there had been
nobody at<br>
 home. Monsieur and madame lived in the studio. Lisbeth,
following the<br>
 turtle doves to their nest at le Gros-Caillou, found Wenceslas
hard at<br>
 work, and was informed by the cook that madame never left
monsieur's<br>
 side. Wenceslas was a slave to the autocracy of love. So now
Valerie,<br>
 on her own account, took part with Lisbeth in her hatred of
Hortense.</p>

<p>Women cling to a lover that another woman is fighting for,
just as<br>
 much as men do to women round whom many coxcombs are buzzing.
Thus any<br>
 reflections <i>a propos</i> to Madame Marneffe are equally
applicable to<br>
 any lady-killing rake; he is, in fact, a sort of male
courtesan.<br>
 Valerie's last fancy was a madness; above all, she was bent on
getting<br>
 her group; she was even thinking of going one morning to the
studio to<br>
 see Wenceslas, when a serious incident arose of the kind which,
to a<br>
 woman of that class, may be called the spoil of war.</p>

<p>This is how Valerie announced this wholly personal event.</p>

<p>She was breakfasting with Lisbeth and her husband.</p>

<p>"I say, Marneffe, what would you say to being a second time a
father?"</p>

<p>"You don't mean it--a baby?--Oh, let me kiss you!"</p>

<p>He rose and went round the table; his wife held up her head so
that he<br>
 could just kiss her hair.</p>

<p>"If that is so," he went on, "I am head-clerk and officer of
the<br>
 Legion of Honor at once. But you must understand, my dear,
Stanislas<br>
 is not to be the sufferer, poor little man."</p>

<p>"Poor little man?" Lisbeth put in. "You have not set your eyes
on him<br>
 these seven months. I am supposed to be his mother at the
school; I am<br>
 the only person in the house who takes any trouble about
him."</p>

<p>"A brat that costs us a hundred crowns a quarter!" said
Valerie. "And<br>
 he, at any rate, is your own child, Marneffe. You ought to pay
for his<br>
 schooling out of your salary.--The newcomer, far from reminding
us of<br>
 butcher's bills, will rescue us from want."</p>

<p>"Valerie," replied Marneffe, assuming an attitude like Crevel,
"I hope<br>
 that Monsieur le Baron Hulot will take proper charge of his son,
and<br>
 not lay the burden on a poor clerk. I intend to keep him well up
to<br>
 the mark. So take the necessary steps, madame! Get him to write
you<br>
 letters in which he alludes to his satisfaction, for he is
rather<br>
 backward in coming forward in regard to my appointment."</p>

<p>And Marneffe went away to the office, where his chief's
precious<br>
 leniency allowed him to come in at about eleven o'clock. And,
indeed,<br>
 he did little enough, for his incapacity was notorious, and
he<br>
 detested work.</p>

<p>No sooner were they alone than Lisbeth and Valerie looked at
each<br>
 other for a moment like Augurs, and both together burst into a
loud<br>
 fit of laughter.</p>

<p>"I say, Valerie--is it the fact?" said Lisbeth, "or merely a
farce?"</p>

<p>"It is a physical fact!" replied Valerie. "Now, I am sick and
tired of<br>
 Hortense; and it occurred to me in the night that I might fire
this<br>
 infant, like a bomb, into the Steinbock household."</p>

<p>Valerie went back to her room, followed by Lisbeth, to whom
she showed<br>
 the following letter:--</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"WENCESLAS MY DEAR,--I still believe in your love, though it
is<br>
 nearly three weeks since I saw you. Is this scorn? Delilah
can<br>
 scarcely believe that. Does it not rather result from the
tyranny<br>
 of a woman whom, as you told me, you can no longer love?<br>
 Wenceslas, you are too great an artist to submit to such
dominion.<br>
 Home is the grave of glory.--Consider now, are you the
Wenceslas<br>
 of the Rue du Doyenne? You missed fire with my father's
statue;<br>
 but in you the lover is greater than the artist, and you have
had<br>
 better luck with his daughter. You are a father, my beloved<br>
 Wenceslas.</p>

<p>"If you do not come to me in the state I am in, your friends
would<br>
 think very badly of you. But I love you so madly, that I feel
I<br>
 should never have the strength to curse you. May I sign myself
as<br>
 ever,</p>

<p>"YOUR VALERIE."</p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
 "What do you say to my scheme for sending this note to the
studio at a<br>
 time when our dear Hortense is there by herself?" asked Valerie.
"Last<br>
 evening I heard from Stidmann that Wenceslas is to pick him up
at<br>
 eleven this morning to go on business to Chanor's; so that
gawk<br>
 Hortense will be there alone."</p>

<p><br>
 "But after such a trick as that," replied Lisbeth, "I cannot
continue<br>
 to be your friend in the eyes of the world; I shall have to
break with<br>
 you, to be supposed never to visit you, or even to speak to
you."</p>

<p>"Evidently," said Valerie; "but--"</p>

<p>"Oh! be quite easy," interrupted Lisbeth; "we shall often meet
when I<br>
 am Madame la Marechale. They are all set upon it now. Only the
Baron<br>
 is in ignorance of the plan, but you can talk him over."</p>

<p>"Well," said Valerie, "but it is quite likely that the Baron
and I may<br>
 be on distant terms before long."</p>

<p>"Madame Olivier is the only person who can make Hortense
demand to see<br>
 the letter," said Lisbeth. "And you must send her to the Rue
Saint-<br>
 Dominique before she goes on to the studio."</p>

<p>"Our beauty will be at home, no doubt," said Valerie, ringing
for<br>
 Reine to call up Madame Olivier.</p>

<p>Ten minutes after the despatch of this fateful letter, Baron
Hulot<br>
 arrived. Madame Marneffe threw her arms round the old man's neck
with<br>
 kittenish impetuosity.</p>

<p>"Hector, you are a father!" she said in his ear. "That is what
comes<br>
 of quarreling and making friends again----"</p>

<p>Perceiving a look of surprise, which the Baron did not at
once<br>
 conceal, Valerie assumed a reserve which brought the old man
to<br>
 despair. She made him wring the proofs from her one by one.
When<br>
 conviction, led on by vanity, had at last entered his mind,
she<br>
 enlarged on Monsieur Marneffe's wrath.</p>

<p>"My dear old veteran," said she, "you can hardly avoid getting
your<br>
 responsible editor, our representative partner if you like,
appointed<br>
 head-clerk and officer of the Legion of Honor, for you really
have<br>
 done for the poor man, he adores his Stanislas, the little
monstrosity<br>
 who is so like him, that to me he is insufferable. Unless you
prefer<br>
 to settle twelve hundred francs a year on Stanislas--the capital
to be<br>
 his, and the life-interest payable to me, of course--"</p>

<p>"But if I am to settle securities, I would rather it should be
on my<br>
 own son, and not on the monstrosity," said the Baron.</p>

<p>This rash speech, in which the words "my own son" came out as
full as<br>
 a river in flood, was, by the end of the hour, ratified as a
formal<br>
 promise to settle twelve hundred francs a year on the future
boy. And<br>
 this promise became, on Valerie's tongue and in her countenance,
what<br>
 a drum is in the hands of a child; for three weeks she played on
it<br>
 incessantly.</p>

<p>At the moment when Baron Hulot was leaving the Rue Vanneau, as
happy<br>
 as a man who after a year of married life still desires an
heir,<br>
 Madame Olivier had yielded to Hortense, and given up the note
she was<br>
 instructed to give only into the Count's own hands. The young
wife<br>
 paid twenty francs for that letter. The wretch who commits
suicide<br>
 must pay for the opium, the pistol, the charcoal.</p>

<p>Hortense read and re-read the note; she saw nothing but this
sheet of<br>
 white paper streaked with black lines; the universe held for
her<br>
 nothing but that paper; everything was dark around her. The
glare of<br>
 the conflagration that was consuming the edifice of her
happiness<br>
 lighted up the page, for blackest night enfolded her. The shouts
of<br>
 her little Wenceslas at play fell on her ear, as if he had been
in the<br>
 depths of a valley and she on a high mountain. Thus insulted at
four-<br>
 and-twenty, in all the splendor of her beauty, enhanced by pure
and<br>
 devoted love--it was not a stab, it was death. The first shock
had<br>
 been merely on the nerves, the physical frame had struggled in
the<br>
 grip of jealousy; but now certainty had seized her soul, her
body was<br>
 unconscious.</p>

<p>For about ten minutes Hortense sat under the incubus of
this<br>
 oppression. Then a vision of her mother appeared before her,
and<br>
 revulsion ensued; she was calm and cool, and mistress of her
reason.</p>

<p>She rang.</p>

<p>"Get Louise to help you, child," said she to the cook. "As
quickly as<br>
 you can, pack up everything that belongs to me and everything
wanted<br>
 for the little boy. I give you an hour. When all is ready, fetch
a<br>
 hackney coach from the stand, and call me.</p>

<p>"Make no remarks! I am leaving the house, and shall take
Louise with<br>
 me. You must stay here with monsieur; take good care of
him----"</p>

<p>She went into her room, and wrote the following letter:--</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"MONSIEUR LE COMTE,--</p>

<p>"The letter I enclose will sufficiently account for the<br>
 determination I have come to.</p>

<p>"When you read this, I shall have left your house and have
found<br>
 refuge with my mother, taking our child with me.</p>

<p>"Do not imagine that I shall retrace my steps. Do not imagine
that<br>
 I am acting with the rash haste of youth, without reflection,
with<br>
 the anger of offended affection; you will be greatly
mistaken.</p>

<p>"I have been thinking very deeply during the last fortnight
of<br>
 life, of love, of our marriage, of our duties to each other.
I<br>
 have known the perfect devotion of my mother; she has told me
all<br>
 her sorrows! She has been heroical--every day for
twenty-three<br>
 years. But I have not the strength to imitate her, not because
I<br>
 love you less than she loves my father, but for reasons of
spirit<br>
 and nature. Our home would be a hell; I might lose my head so
far<br>
 as to disgrace you--disgrace myself and our child.</p>

<p>"I refuse to be a Madame Marneffe; once launched on such a
course,<br>
 a woman of my temper might not, perhaps, be able to stop. I
am,<br>
 unfortunately for myself, a Hulot, not a Fischer.</p>

<p>"Alone, and absent from the scene of your dissipations, I am
sure<br>
 of myself, especially with my child to occupy me, and by the
side<br>
 of a strong and noble mother, whose life cannot fail to
influence<br>
 the vehement impetuousness of my feelings. There, I can be a
good<br>
 mother, bring our boy up well, and live. Under your roof the
wife<br>
 would oust the mother; and constant contention would sour my<br>
 temper.</p>

<p>"I can accept a death-blow, but I will not endure for
twenty-five<br>
 years, like my mother. If, at the end of three years of
perfect,<br>
 unwavering love, you can be unfaithful to me with your
father-in-<br>
 law's mistress, what rivals may I expect to have in later
years?<br>
 Indeed, monsieur, you have begun your career of profligacy
much<br>
 earlier than my father did, the life of dissipation, which is
a<br>
 disgrace to the father of a family, which undermines the
respect<br>
 of his children, and which ends in shame and despair.</p>

<p>"I am not unforgiving. Unrelenting feelings do not beseem
erring<br>
 creatures living under the eye of God. If you win fame and
fortune<br>
 by sustained work, if you have nothing to do with courtesans
and<br>
 ignoble, defiling ways, you will find me still a wife worthy
of<br>
 you.</p>

<p>"I believe you to be too much a gentleman, Monsieur le Comte,
to<br>
 have recourse to the law. You will respect my wishes, and leave
me<br>
 under my mother's roof. Above all, never let me see you there.
I<br>
 have left all the money lent to you by that odious woman.--<br>
 Farewell.</p>

<p>"HORTENSE HULOT."</p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
 This letter was written in anguish. Hortense abandoned herself
to the<br>
 tears, the outcries of murdered love. She laid down her pen and
took<br>
 it up again, to express as simply as possible all that
passion<br>
 commonly proclaims in this sort of testamentary letter. Her
heart went<br>
 forth in exclamations, wailing and weeping; but reason dictated
the<br>
 words.</p>

<p><br>
 Informed by Louise that all was ready, the young wife slowly
went<br>
 round the little garden, through the bedroom and drawing-room,
looking<br>
 at everything for the last time. Then she earnestly enjoined the
cook<br>
 to take the greatest care for her master's comfort, promising
to<br>
 reward her handsomely if she would be honest. At last she got
into the<br>
 hackney coach to drive to her mother's house, her heart quite
broken,<br>
 crying so much as to distress the maid, and covering little
Wenceslas<br>
 with kisses, which betrayed her still unfailing love for his
father.</p>

<p>The Baroness knew already from Lisbeth that the father-in-law
was<br>
 largely to blame for the son-in-law's fault; nor was she
surprised to<br>
 see her daughter, whose conduct she approved, and she consented
to<br>
 give her shelter. Adeline, perceiving that her own gentleness
and<br>
 patience had never checked Hector, for whom her respect was
indeed<br>
 fast diminishing, thought her daughter very right to adopt
another<br>
 course.</p>

<p>In three weeks the poor mother had suffered two wounds of
which the<br>
 pain was greater than any ill-fortune she had hitherto endured.
The<br>
 Baron had placed Victorin and his wife in great difficulties;
and<br>
 then, by Lisbeth's account, he was the cause of his
son-in-law's<br>
 misconduct, and had corrupted Wenceslas. The dignity of the
father of<br>
 the family, so long upheld by her really foolish self-sacrifice,
was<br>
 now overthrown. Though they did not regret the money the young
Hulots<br>
 were full alike of doubts and uneasiness as regarded the Baron.
This<br>
 sentiment, which was evidence enough, distressed the Baroness;
she<br>
 foresaw a break-up of the family tie.</p>

<p>Hortense was accommodated in the dining-room, arranged as a
bedroom<br>
 with the help of the Marshal's money, and the anteroom became
the<br>
 dining-room, as it is in many apartments.</p>

<p>When Wenceslas returned home and had read the two letters, he
felt a<br>
 kind of gladness mingled with regret. Kept so constantly under
his<br>
 wife's eye, so to speak, he had inwardly rebelled against this
fresh<br>
 thraldom, <i>a la</i> Lisbeth. Full fed with love for three
years past, he<br>
 too had been reflecting during the last fortnight; and he found
a<br>
 family heavy on his hands. He had just been congratulated by
Stidmann<br>
 on the passion he had inspired in Valerie; for Stidmann, with
an<br>
 under-thought that was not unnatural, saw that he might flatter
the<br>
 husband's vanity in the hope of consoling the victim. And
Wenceslas<br>
 was glad to be able to return to Madame Marneffe.</p>

<p>Still, he remembered the pure and unsullied happiness he had
known,<br>
 the perfections of his wife, her judgment, her innocent and
guileless<br>
 affection,--and he regretted her acutely. He thought of going at
once<br>
 to his mother-in-law's to crave forgiveness; but, in fact, like
Hulot<br>
 and Crevel, he went to Madame Marneffe, to whom he carried his
wife's<br>
 letter to show her what a disaster she had caused, and to
discount his<br>
 misfortune, so to speak, by claiming in return the pleasures
his<br>
 mistress could give him.</p>

<p>He found Crevel with Valerie. The mayor, puffed up with pride,
marched<br>
 up and down the room, agitated by a storm of feelings. He put
himself<br>
 into position as if he were about to speak, but he dared not.
His<br>
 countenance was beaming, and he went now and again to the
window,<br>
 where he drummed on the pane with his fingers. He kept looking
at<br>
 Valerie with a glance of tender pathos. Happily for him,
Lisbeth<br>
 presently came in.</p>

<p>"Cousin Betty," he said in her ear, "have you heard the news?
I am a<br>
 father! It seems to me I love my poor Celestine the less.--Oh!
what a<br>
 thing it is to have a child by the woman one idolizes! It is
the<br>
 fatherhood of the heart added to that of the flesh! I
say--tell<br>
 Valerie that I will work for that child--it shall be rich. She
tells<br>
 me she has some reason for believing that it will be a boy! If
it is a<br>
 boy, I shall insist on his being called Crevel. I will consult
my<br>
 notary about it."</p>

<p>"I know how much she loves you," said Lisbeth. "But for her
sake in<br>
 the future, and for your own, control yourself. Do not rub your
hands<br>
 every five minutes."</p>

<p>While Lisbeth was speaking aside on this wise to Crevel,
Valerie had<br>
 asked Wenceslas to give her back her letter, and she was saying
things<br>
 that dispelled all his griefs.</p>

<p>"So now you are free, my dear," said she. "Ought any great
artist to<br>
 marry? You live only by fancy and freedom! There, I shall love
you so<br>
 much, beloved poet, that you shall never regret your wife. At
the same<br>
 time, if, like so many people, you want to keep up appearances,
I<br>
 undertake to bring Hortense back to you in a very short
time."</p>

<p>"Oh, if only that were possible!"</p>

<p>"I am certain of it," said Valerie, nettled. "Your poor
father-in-law<br>
 is a man who is in every way utterly done for; who wants to
appear as<br>
 though he could be loved, out of conceit, and to make the
world<br>
 believe that he has a mistress; and he is so excessively vain on
this<br>
 point, that I can do what I please with him. The Baroness is
still so<br>
 devoted to her old Hector--I always feel as if I were talking of
the<br>
 <i>Iliad</i>--that these two old folks will contrive to patch up
matters<br>
 between you and Hortense. Only, if you want to avoid storms at
home<br>
 for the future, do not leave me for three weeks without coming
to see<br>
 your mistress--I was dying of it. My dear boy, some
consideration is<br>
 due from a gentleman to a woman he has so deeply
compromised,<br>
 especially when, as in my case, she has to be very careful of
her<br>
 reputation.</p>

<p>"Stay to dinner, my darling--and remember that I must treat
you with<br>
 all the more apparent coldness because you are guilty of this
too<br>
 obvious mishap."</p>

<p>Baron Montes was presently announced; Valerie rose and hurried
forward<br>
 to meet him; she spoke a few sentences in his ear, enjoining on
him<br>
 the same reserve as she had impressed on Wenceslas; the
Brazilian<br>
 assumed a diplomatic reticence suitable to the great news which
filled<br>
 him with delight, for he, at any rate was sure of his
paternity.</p>

<p>Thanks to these tactics, based on the vanity of the man in the
lover<br>
 stage of his existence, Valerie sat down to table with four men,
all<br>
 pleased and eager to please, all charmed, and each believing
himself<br>
 adored; called by Marneffe, who included himself, in speaking
to<br>
 Lisbeth, the five Fathers of the Church.</p>

<p>Baron Hulot alone at first showed an anxious countenance, and
this was<br>
 why. Just as he was leaving the office, the head of the staff
of<br>
 clerks had come to his private room--a General with whom he had
served<br>
 for thirty years--and Hulot had spoken to him as to
appointing<br>
 Marneffe to Coquet's place, Coquet having consented to
retire.</p>

<p>"My dear fellow," said he, "I would not ask this favor of the
Prince<br>
 without our having agreed on the matter, and knowing that
you<br>
 approved."</p>

<p>"My good friend," replied the other, "you must allow me to
observe<br>
 that, for your own sake, you should not insist on this
nomination. I<br>
 have already told you my opinion. There would be a scandal in
the<br>
 office, where there is a great deal too much talk already about
you<br>
 and Madame Marneffe. This, of course, is between ourselves. I
have no<br>
 wish to touch you on a sensitive spot, or disoblige you in any
way,<br>
 and I will prove it. If you are determined to get Monsieur
Coquet's<br>
 place, and he will really be a loss in the War Office, for he
has been<br>
 here since 1809, I will go into the country for a fortnight, so
as to<br>
 leave the field open between you and the Marshal, who loves you
as a<br>
 son. Then I shall take neither part, and shall have nothing on
my<br>
 conscience as an administrator."</p>

<p>"Thank you very much," said Hulot. "I will reflect on what you
have<br>
 said."</p>

<p>"In allowing myself to say so much, my dear friend, it is
because your<br>
 personal interest is far more deeply implicated than any concern
or<br>
 vanity of mine. In the first place, the matter lies entirely
with the<br>
 Marshal. And then, my good fellow, we are blamed for so many
things,<br>
 that one more or less! We are not at the maiden stage in our<br>
 experience of fault-finding. Under the Restoration, men were put
in<br>
 simply to give them places, without any regard for the
office.--We are<br>
 old friends----"</p>

<p>"Yes," the Baron put in; "and it is in order not to impair our
old and<br>
 valued friendship that I--"</p>

<p>"Well, well," said the departmental manager, seeing Hulot's
face<br>
 clouded with embarrassment, "I will take myself off, old
fellow.--But<br>
 I warn you! you have enemies--that is to say, men who covet
your<br>
 splendid appointment, and you have but one anchor out. Now if,
like<br>
 me, you were a Deputy, you would have nothing to fear; so mind
what<br>
 you are about."</p>

<p>This speech, in the most friendly spirit, made a deep
impression on<br>
 the Councillor of State.</p>

<p>"But, after all, Roger, what is it that is wrong? Do not make
any<br>
 mysteries with me."</p>

<p>The individual addressed as Roger looked at Hulot, took his
hand, and<br>
 pressed it.</p>

<p>"We are such old friends, that I am bound to give you warning.
If you<br>
 want to keep your place, you must make a bed for yourself, and
instead<br>
 of asking the Marshal to give Coquet's place to Marneffe, in
your<br>
 place I would beg him to use his influence to reserve a seat for
me on<br>
 the General Council of State; there you may die in peace, and,
like<br>
 the beaver, abandon all else to the pursuers."</p>

<p>"What, do you think the Marshal would forget--"</p>

<p>"The Marshal has already taken your part so warmly at a
General<br>
 Meeting of the Ministers, that you will not now be turned out;
but it<br>
 was seriously discussed! So give them no excuse. I can say no
more. At<br>
 this moment you may make your own terms; you may sit on the
Council of<br>
 State and be made a Peer of the Chamber. If you delay too long,
if you<br>
 give any one a hold against you, I can answer for nothing.--Now,
am I<br>
 to go?"</p>

<p>"Wait a little. I will see the Marshal," replied Hulot, "and I
will<br>
 send my brother to see which way the wind blows at
headquarters."</p>

<p>The humor in which the Baron came back to Madame Marneffe's
may be<br>
 imagined; he had almost forgotten his fatherhood, for Roger had
taken<br>
 the part of a true and kind friend in explaining the position.
At the<br>
 same time Valerie's influence was so great that, by the middle
of<br>
 dinner, the Baron was tuned up to the pitch, and was all the
more<br>
 cheerful for having unwonted anxieties to conceal; but the
hapless man<br>
 was not yet aware that in the course of that evening he would
find<br>
 himself in a cleft stick, between his happiness and the danger
pointed<br>
 out by his friend--compelled, in short, to choose between
Madame<br>
 Marneffe and his official position.</p>

<p>At eleven o'clock, when the evening was at its gayest, for the
room<br>
 was full of company, Valerie drew Hector into a corner of her
sofa.</p>

<p>"My dear old boy," said she, "your daughter is so annoyed at
knowing<br>
 that Wenceslas comes here, that she has left him 'planted.'
Hortense<br>
 is wrong-headed. Ask Wenceslas to show you the letter the little
fool<br>
 has written to him.</p>

<p>"This division of two lovers, of which I am reputed to be the
cause,<br>
 may do me the greatest harm, for this is how virtuous women
undermine<br>
 each other. It is disgraceful to pose as a victim in order to
cast the<br>
 blame on a woman whose only crime is that she keeps a pleasant
house.<br>
 If you love me, you will clear my character by reconciling the
sweet<br>
 turtle-doves.</p>

<p>"I do not in the least care about your son-in-law's visits;
you<br>
 brought him here--take him away again! If you have any authority
in<br>
 your family, it seems to me that you may very well insist on
your<br>
 wife's patching up this squabble. Tell the worthy old lady from
me,<br>
 that if I am unjustly charged with having caused a young couple
to<br>
 quarrel, with upsetting the unity of a family, and annexing both
the<br>
 father and the son-in-law, I will deserve my reputation by
annoying<br>
 them in my own way! Why, here is Lisbeth talking of throwing me
over!<br>
 She prefers to stick to her family, and I cannot blame her for
it. She<br>
 will throw me over, says she, unless the young people make
friends<br>
 again. A pretty state of things! Our expenses here will be
trebled!"</p>

<p><br>
 "Oh, as for that!" said the Baron, on hearing of his daughter's
strong<br>
 measures, "I will have no nonsense of that kind."</p>

<p>"Very well," said Valerie. "And now for the next thing.--What
about<br>
 Coquet's place?"</p>

<p>"That," said Hector, looking away, "is more difficult, not to
say<br>
 impossible."</p>

<p>"Impossible, my dear Hector?" said Madame Marneffe in the
Baron's ear.<br>
 "But you do not know to what lengths Marneffe will go. I am
completely<br>
 in his power; he is immoral for his own gratification, like most
men,<br>
 but he is excessively vindictive, like all weak and impotent
natures.<br>
 In the position to which you have reduced me, I am in his power.
I am<br>
 bound to be on terms with him for a few days, and he is quite
capable<br>
 of refusing to leave my room any more."</p>

<p>Hulot started with horror.</p>

<p>"He would leave me alone on condition of being head-clerk. It
is<br>
 abominable--but logical."</p>

<p>"Valerie, do you love me?"</p>

<p>"In the state in which I am, my dear, the question is the
meanest<br>
 insult."</p>

<p>"Well, then--if I were to attempt, merely to attempt, to ask
the<br>
 Prince for a place for Marneffe, I should be done for, and
Marneffe<br>
 would be turned out."</p>

<p>"I thought that you and the Prince were such intimate
friends."</p>

<p>"We are, and he has amply proved it; but, my child, there is
authority<br>
 above the Marshal's--for instance, the whole Council of
Ministers.<br>
 With time and a little tacking, we shall get there. But, to
succeed, I<br>
 must wait till the moment when some service is required of me.
Then I<br>
 can say one good turn deserves another--"</p>

<p>"If I tell Marneffe this tale, my poor Hector, he will play us
some<br>
 mean trick. You must tell him yourself that he has to wait. I
will not<br>
 undertake to do so. Oh! I know what my fate would be. He knows
how to<br>
 punish me! He will henceforth share my room----</p>

<p>"Do not forget to settle the twelve hundred francs a year on
the<br>
 little one!"</p>

<p>Hulot, seeing his pleasures in danger, took Monsieur Marneffe
aside,<br>
 and for the first time derogated from the haughty tone he had
always<br>
 assumed towards him, so greatly was he horrified by the thought
of<br>
 that half-dead creature in his pretty young wife's bedroom.</p>

<p>"Marneffe, my dear fellow," said he, "I have been talking of
you<br>
 to-day. But you cannot be promoted to the first class just yet.
We<br>
 must have time."</p>

<p>"I will be, Monsieur le Baron," said Marneffe shortly.</p>

<p>"But, my dear fellow--"</p>

<p>"I <i>will</i> be, Monsieur le Baron," Marneffe coldly
repeated, looking<br>
 alternately at the Baron and at Valerie. "You have placed my
wife in a<br>
 position that necessitates her making up her differences with
me, and<br>
 I mean to keep her; for, <i>my dear fellow</i>, she is a
charming<br>
 creature," he added, with crushing irony. "I am master
here--more than<br>
 you are at the War Office."</p>

<p>The Baron felt one of those pangs of fury which have the
effect, in<br>
 the heart, of a fit of raging toothache, and he could hardly
conceal<br>
 the tears in his eyes.</p>

<p>During this little scene, Valerie had been explaining
Marneffe's<br>
 imaginary determination to Montes, and thus had rid herself of
him for<br>
 a time.</p>

<p>Of her four adherents, Crevel alone was exempted from the
rule--<br>
 Crevel, the master of the little "bijou" apartment; and he
displayed<br>
 on his countenance an air of really insolent beatitude,<br>
 notwithstanding the wordless reproofs administered by Valerie
in<br>
 frowns and meaning grimaces. His triumphant paternity beamed in
every<br>
 feature.</p>

<p>When Valerie was whispering a word of correction in his ear,
he<br>
 snatched her hand, and put in:</p>

<p>"To-morrow, my Duchess, you shall have your own little house!
The<br>
 papers are to be signed to-morrow."</p>

<p>"And the furniture?" said she, with a smile.</p>

<p>"I have a thousand shares in the Versailles <i>rive gauche</i>
railway. I<br>
 bought them at twenty-five, and they will go up to three hundred
in<br>
 consequence of the amalgamation of the two lines, which is a
secret<br>
 told to me. You shall have furniture fit for a queen. But then
you<br>
 will be mine alone henceforth?"</p>

<p>"Yes, burly Maire," said this middle-class Madame de Merteuil.
"But<br>
 behave yourself; respect the future Madame Crevel."</p>

<p>"My dear cousin," Lisbeth was saying to the Baron, "I shall go
to see<br>
 Adeline early to-morrow; for, as you must see, I cannot, with
any<br>
 decency, remain here. I will go and keep house for your brother
the<br>
 Marshal."</p>

<p>"I am going home this evening," said Hulot.</p>

<p>"Very well, you will see me at breakfast to-morrow," said
Lisbeth,<br>
 smiling.</p>

<p>She understood that her presence would be necessary at the
family<br>
 scene that would take place on the morrow. And the very first
thing in<br>
 the morning she went to see Victorin and to tell him that
Hortense and<br>
 Wenceslas had parted.</p>

<p>When the Baron went home at half-past ten, Mariette and
Louise, who<br>
 had had a hard day, were locking up the apartment. Hulot had not
to<br>
 ring.</p>

<p>Very much put out at this compulsory virtue, the husband went
straight<br>
 to his wife's room, and through the half-open door he saw her
kneeling<br>
 before her Crucifix, absorbed in prayer, in one of those
attitudes<br>
 which make the fortune of the painter or the sculptor who is so
happy<br>
 to invent and then to express them. Adeline, carried away by
her<br>
 enthusiasm, was praying aloud:</p>

<p>"O God, have mercy and enlighten him!"</p>

<p>The Baroness was praying for her Hector.</p>

<p>At this sight, so unlike what he had just left, and on hearing
this<br>
 petition founded on the events of the day, the Baron heaved a
sigh of<br>
 deep emotion. Adeline looked round, her face drowned in tears.
She was<br>
 so convinced that her prayer had been heard, that, with one
spring,<br>
 she threw her arms round Hector with the impetuosity of
happy<br>
 affection. Adeline had given up all a wife's instincts; sorrow
had<br>
 effaced even the memory of them. No feeling survived in her but
those<br>
 of motherhood, of the family honor, and the pure attachment of
a<br>
 Christian wife for a husband who has gone astray--the
saintly<br>
 tenderness which survives all else in a woman's soul.</p>

<p>"Hector!" she said, "are you come back to us? Has God taken
pity on<br>
 our family?"</p>

<p>"Dear Adeline," replied the Baron, coming in and seating his
wife by<br>
 his side on a couch, "you are the saintliest creature I ever
knew; I<br>
 have long known myself to be unworthy of you."</p>

<p>"You would have very little to do, my dear," said she, holding
Hulot's<br>
 hand and trembling so violently that it was as though she had a
palsy,<br>
 "very little to set things in order--"</p>

<p>She dared not proceed; she felt that every word would be a
reproof,<br>
 and she did not wish to mar the happiness with which this
meeting was<br>
 inundating her soul.</p>

<p>"It is Hortense who has brought me here," said Hulot. "That
child may<br>
 do us far more harm by her hasty proceeding than my absurd
passion for<br>
 Valerie has ever done. But we will discuss all this to-morrow
morning.<br>
 Hortense is asleep, Mariette tells me; we will not disturb
her."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Madame Hulot, suddenly plunged into the depths of
grief.</p>

<p>She understood that the Baron's return was prompted not so
much by the<br>
 wish to see his family as by some ulterior interest.</p>

<p>"Leave her in peace till to-morrow," said the mother. "The
poor child<br>
 is in a deplorable condition; she has been crying all day."</p>

<p>At nine the next morning, the Baron, awaiting his daughter,
whom he<br>
 had sent for, was pacing the large, deserted drawing-room,
trying to<br>
 find arguments by which to conquer the most difficult form
of<br>
 obstinacy there is to deal with--that of a young wife, offended
and<br>
 implacable, as blameless youth ever is, in its ignorance of
the<br>
 disgraceful compromises of the world, of its passions and
interests.</p>

<p>"Here I am, papa," said Hortense in a tremulous voice, and
looking<br>
 pale from her miseries.</p>

<p>Hulot, sitting down, took his daughter round the waist, and
drew her<br>
 down to sit on his knee.</p>

<p>"Well, my child," said he, kissing her forehead, "so there
are<br>
 troubles at home, and you have been hasty and headstrong? That
is not<br>
 like a well-bred child. My Hortense ought not to have taken such
a<br>
 decisive step as that of leaving her house and deserting her
husband<br>
 on her own account, and without consulting her parents. If my
darling<br>
 girl had come to see her kind and admirable mother, she would
not have<br>
 given me this cruel pain I feel!--You do not know the world; it
is<br>
 malignantly spiteful. People will perhaps say that your husband
sent<br>
 you back to your parents. Children brought up as you were, on
your<br>
 mother's lap, remain artless; maidenly passion like yours
for<br>
 Wenceslas, unfortunately, makes no allowances; it acts on
every<br>
 impulse. The little heart is moved, the head follows suit. You
would<br>
 burn down Paris to be revenged, with no thought of the courts
of<br>
 justice!</p>

<p>"When your old father tells you that you have outraged the<br>
 proprieties, you may take his word for it.--I say nothing of the
cruel<br>
 pain you have given me. It is bitter, I assure you, for you
throw all<br>
 the blame on a woman of whose heart you know nothing, and
whose<br>
 hostility may become disastrous. And you, alas! so full of
guileless<br>
 innocence and purity, can have no suspicions; but you may be
vilified<br>
 and slandered.--Besides, my darling pet, you have taken a
foolish jest<br>
 too seriously. I can assure you, on my honor, that your husband
is<br>
 blameless. Madame Marneffe--"</p>

<p>So far the Baron, artistically diplomatic, had formulated
his<br>
 remonstrances very judiciously. He had, as may be observed,
worked up<br>
 to the mention of this name with superior skill; and yet
Hortense, as<br>
 she heard it, winced as if stung to the quick.</p>

<p>"Listen to me; I have had great experience, and I have seen
much," he<br>
 went on, stopping his daughter's attempt to speak. "That lady is
very<br>
 cold to your husband. Yes, you have been made the victim of
a<br>
 practical joke, and I will prove it to you. Yesterday Wenceslas
was<br>
 dining with her--"</p>

<p>"Dining with her!" cried the young wife, starting to her feet,
and<br>
 looking at her father with horror in every feature. "Yesterday!
After<br>
 having had my letter! Oh, great God!--Why did I not take the
veil<br>
 rather than marry? But now my life is not my own! I have the
child!"<br>
 and she sobbed.</p>

<p>Her weeping went to Madame Hulot's heart. She came out of her
room and<br>
 ran to her daughter, taking her in her arms, and asking her
those<br>
 questions, stupid with grief, which first rose to her lips.</p>

<p>"Now we have tears," said the Baron to himself, "and all was
going so<br>
 well! What is to be done with women who cry?"</p>

<p>"My child," said the Baroness, "listen to your father! He
loves us all<br>
 --come, come--"</p>

<p>"Come, Hortense, my dear little girl, cry no more, you make
yourself<br>
 too ugly!" said the Baron, "Now, be a little reasonable. Go
sensibly<br>
 home, and I promise you that Wenceslas shall never set foot in
that<br>
 woman's house. I ask you to make the sacrifice, if it is a
sacrifice<br>
 to forgive the husband you love so small a fault. I ask you--for
the<br>
 sake of my gray hairs, and of the love you owe your mother. You
do not<br>
 want to blight my later years with bitterness and regret?"</p>

<p>Hortense fell at her father's feet like a crazed thing, with
the<br>
 vehemence of despair; her hair, loosely pinned up, fell about
her, and<br>
 she held out her hands with an expression that painted her
misery.</p>

<p>"Father," she said, "ask my life! Take it if you will, but at
least<br>
 take it pure and spotless, and I will yield it up gladly. Do not
ask<br>
 me to die in dishonor and crime. I am not at all like my
husband; I<br>
 cannot swallow an outrage. If I went back under my husband's
roof, I<br>
 should be capable of smothering him in a fit of jealousy--or of
doing<br>
 worse! Do no exact from me a thing that is beyond my powers. Do
not<br>
 have to mourn for me still living, for the least that can befall
me is<br>
 to go mad. I feel madness close upon me!</p>

<p><br>
 "Yesterday, yesterday, he could dine with that woman, after
having<br>
 read my letter?--Are other men made so? My life I give you, but
do not<br>
 let my death be ignominious!--His fault?--A small one! When he
has a<br>
 child by that woman!"</p>

<p>"A child!" cried Hulot, starting back a step or two. "Come.
This is<br>
 really some fooling."</p>

<p>At this juncture Victorin and Lisbeth arrived, and stood
dumfounded at<br>
 the scene. The daughter was prostrate at her father's feet.
The<br>
 Baroness, speechless between her maternal feelings and her
conjugal<br>
 duty, showed a harassed face bathed in tears.</p>

<p>"Lisbeth," said the Baron, seizing his cousin by the hand and
pointing<br>
 to Hortense, "you can help me here. My poor child's brain is
turned;<br>
 she believes that her Wenceslas is Madame Marneffe's lover,
while all<br>
 that Valerie wanted was to have a group by him."</p>

<p>"<i>Delilah</i>!" cried the young wife. "The only thing he has
done since<br>
 our marriage. The man would not work for me or for his son, and
he has<br>
 worked with frenzy for that good-for-nothing creature.--Oh,
father,<br>
 kill me outright, for every word stabs like a knife!"</p>

<p>Lisbeth turned to the Baroness and Victorin, pointing with a
pitying<br>
 shrug to the Baron, who could not see her.</p>

<p>"Listen to me," said she to him. "I had no idea--when you
asked me to<br>
 go to lodge over Madame Marneffe and keep house for her--I had
no idea<br>
 of what she was; but many things may be learned in three years.
That<br>
 creature is a prostitute, and one whose depravity can only be
compared<br>
 with that of her infamous and horrible husband. You are the
dupe, my<br>
 lord pot-boiler, of those people; you will be led further by
them than<br>
 you dream of! I speak plainly, for you are at the bottom of a
pit."</p>

<p>The Baroness and her daughter, hearing Lisbeth speak in this
style,<br>
 cast adoring looks at her, such as the devout cast at a Madonna
for<br>
 having saved their life.</p>

<p>"That horrible woman was bent on destroying your son-in-law's
home. To<br>
 what end?--I know not. My brain is not equal to seeing clearly
into<br>
 these dark intrigues--perverse, ignoble, infamous! Your
Madame<br>
 Marneffe does not love your son-in-law, but she will have him at
her<br>
 feet out of revenge. I have just spoken to the wretched woman as
she<br>
 deserves. She is a shameless courtesan; I have told her that I
am<br>
 leaving her house, that I would not have my honor smirched in
that<br>
 muck-heap.--I owe myself to my family before all else.</p>

<p>"I knew that Hortense had left her husband, so here I am.
Your<br>
 Valerie, whom you believe to be a saint, is the cause of
this<br>
 miserable separation; can I remain with such a woman? Our poor
little<br>
 Hortense," said she, touching the Baron's arm, with peculiar
meaning,<br>
 "is perhaps the dupe of a wish of such women as these, who, to
possess<br>
 a toy, would sacrifice a family.</p>

<p>"I do not think Wenceslas guilty; but I think him weak, and I
cannot<br>
 promise that he will not yield to her refinements of
temptation.--My<br>
 mind is made up. The woman is fatal to you; she will bring you
all to<br>
 utter ruin. I will not even seem to be concerned in the
destruction of<br>
 my own family, after living there for three years solely to
hinder it.</p>

<p>"You are cheated, Baron; say very positively that you will
have<br>
 nothing to say to the promotion of that dreadful Marneffe, and
you<br>
 will see then! There is a fine rod in pickle for you in that
case."</p>

<p>Lisbeth lifted up Hortense and kissed her
enthusiastically.</p>

<p>"My dear Hortense, stand firm," she whispered.</p>

<p>The Baroness embraced Lisbeth with the vehemence of a woman
who sees<br>
 herself avenged. The whole family stood in perfect silence round
the<br>
 father, who had wit enough to know what that silence implied. A
storm<br>
 of fury swept across his brow and face with evident signs; the
veins<br>
 swelled, his eyes were bloodshot, his flesh showed patches of
color.<br>
 Adeline fell on her knees before him and seized his hands.</p>

<p>"My dear, forgive, my dear!"</p>

<p>"You loathe me!" cried the Baron--the cry of his
conscience.</p>

<p>For we all know the secret of our own wrong-doing. We almost
always<br>
 ascribe to our victims the hateful feelings which must fill them
with<br>
 the hope of revenge; and in spite of every effort of hypocrisy,
our<br>
 tongue or our face makes confession under the rack of some
unexpected<br>
 anguish, as the criminal of old confessed under the hands of
the<br>
 torturer.</p>

<p>"Our children," he went on, to retract the avowal, "turn at
last to be<br>
 our enemies--"</p>

<p>"Father!" Victorin began.</p>

<p>"You dare to interrupt your father!" said the Baron in a voice
of<br>
 thunder, glaring at his son.</p>

<p>"Father, listen to me," Victorin went on in a clear, firm
voice, the<br>
 voice of a puritanical deputy. "I know the respect I owe you too
well<br>
 ever to fail in it, and you will always find me the most
respectful<br>
 and submissive of sons."</p>

<p>Those who are in the habit of attending the sittings of the
Chamber<br>
 will recognize the tactics of parliamentary warfare in these
fine-<br>
 drawn phrases, used to calm the factions while gaining time.</p>

<p>"We are far from being your enemies," his son went on. "I
have<br>
 quarreled with my father-in-law, Monsieur Crevel, for having
rescued<br>
 your notes of hand for sixty thousand francs from Vauvinet, and
that<br>
 money is, beyond doubt, in Madame Marneffe's pocket.--I am not
finding<br>
 fault with you, father," said he, in reply to an impatient
gesture of<br>
 the Baron's; "I simply wish to add my protest to my cousin
Lisbeth's,<br>
 and to point out to you that though my devotion to you as a
father is<br>
 blind and unlimited, my dear father, our pecuniary
resources,<br>
 unfortunately, are very limited."</p>

<p>"Money!" cried the excitable old man, dropping on to a chair,
quite<br>
 crushed by this argument. "From my son!--You shall be repaid
your<br>
 money, sir," said he, rising, and he went to the door.</p>

<p>"Hector!"</p>

<p>At this cry the Baron turned round, suddenly showing his wife
a face<br>
 bathed in tears; she threw her arms round him with the strength
of<br>
 despair.</p>

<p>"Do not leave us thus--do not go away in anger. I have not
said a word<br>
 --not I!"</p>

<p>At this heart-wrung speech the children fell at their father's
feet.</p>

<p>"We all love you," said Hortense.</p>

<p>Lisbeth, as rigid as a statue, watched the group with a
superior smile<br>
 on her lips. Just then Marshal Hulot's voice was heard in
the<br>
 anteroom. The family all felt the importance of secrecy, and the
scene<br>
 suddenly changed. The young people rose, and every one tried to
hide<br>
 all traces of emotion.</p>

<p>A discussion was going on at the door between Mariette and a
soldier,<br>
 who was so persistent that the cook came in.</p>

<p>"Monsieur, a regimental quartermaster, who says he is just
come from<br>
 Algiers, insists on seeing you."</p>

<p>"Tell him to wait."</p>

<p>"Monsieur," said Mariette to her master in an undertone, "he
told me<br>
 to tell you privately that it has to do with your uncle
there."</p>

<p>The Baron started; he believed that the funds had been sent at
last<br>
 which he had been asking for these two months, to pay up his
bills; he<br>
 left the family-party, and hurried out to the anteroom.</p>

<p>"You are Monsieur de Paron Hulot?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Your own self?"</p>

<p>"My own self."</p>

<p>The man, who had been fumbling meanwhile in the lining of his
cap,<br>
 drew out a letter, of which the Baron hastily broke the seal,
and read<br>
 as follows:--</p>

<p>"DEAR NEPHEW,--Far from being able to send you the hundred<br>
 thousand francs you ask of me, my present position is not
tenable<br>
 unless you can take some decisive steps to save me. We are
saddled<br>
 with a public prosecutor who talks goody, and rhodomontades<br>
 nonsense about the management. It is impossible to get the
black-<br>
 chokered pump to hold his tongue. If the War Minister allows<br>
 civilians to feed out of his hand, I am done for. I can trust
the<br>
 bearer; try to get him promoted; he has done us good service.
Do<br>
 not abandon me to the crows!"</p>

<p>This letter was a thunderbolt; the Baron could read in it
the<br>
 intestine warfare between civil and military authorities, which
to<br>
 this day hampers the Government, and he was required to invent
on the<br>
 spot some palliative for the difficulty that stared him in the
face.<br>
 He desired the soldier to come back next day, dismissing him
with<br>
 splendid promises of promotion, and he returned to the
drawing-room.<br>
 "Good-day and good-bye, brother," said he to the
Marshal.--"Good-bye,<br>
 children.--Good-bye, my dear Adeline.--And what are you going to
do,<br>
 Lisbeth?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I?--I am going to keep house for the Marshal, for I must end
my days<br>
 doing what I can for one or another of you."</p>

<p>"Do not leave Valerie till I have seen you again," said Hulot
in his<br>
 cousin's ear.--"Good-bye, Hortense, refractory little puss; try
to be<br>
 reasonable. I have important business to be attended to at once;
we<br>
 will discuss your reconciliation another time. Now, think it
over, my<br>
 child," said he as he kissed her.</p>

<p>And he went away, so evidently uneasy, that his wife and
children felt<br>
 the gravest apprehensions.</p>

<p>"Lisbeth," said the Baroness, "I must find out what is wrong
with<br>
 Hector; I never saw him in such a state. Stay a day or two
longer with<br>
 that woman; he tells her everything, and we can then learn what
has so<br>
 suddenly upset him. Be quite easy; we will arrange your marriage
to<br>
 the Marshal, for it is really necessary."</p>

<p>"I shall never forget the courage you have shown this
morning," said<br>
 Hortense, embracing Lisbeth.</p>

<p>"You have avenged our poor mother," said Victorin.</p>

<p>The Marshal looked on with curiosity at all the display of
affection<br>
 lavished on Lisbeth, who went off to report the scene to
Valerie.</p>

<p>This sketch will enable guileless souls to understand what
various<br>
 mischief Madame Marneffes may do in a family, and the means by
which<br>
 they reach poor virtuous wives apparently so far out of their
ken. And<br>
 then, if we only transfer, in fancy, such doings to the upper
class of<br>
 society about a throne, and if we consider what kings'
mistresses must<br>
 have cost them, we may estimate the debt owed by a nation to
a<br>
 sovereign who sets the example of a decent and domestic
life.</p>

<p>In Paris each ministry is a little town by itself, whence
women are<br>
 banished; but there is just as much detraction and scandal as
though<br>
 the feminine population were admitted there. At the end of
three<br>
 years, Monsieur Marneffe's position was perfectly clear and open
to<br>
 the day, and in every room one and another asked, "Is Marneffe
to be,<br>
 or not to be, Coquet's successor?" Exactly as the question might
have<br>
 been put to the Chamber, "Will the estimates pass or not pass?"
The<br>
 smallest initiative on the part of the board of Management
was<br>
 commented on; everything in Baron Hulot's department was
carefully<br>
 noted. The astute State Councillor had enlisted on his side the
victim<br>
 of Marneffe's promotion, a hard-working clerk, telling him that
if he<br>
 could fill Marneffe's place, he would certainly succeed to it;
he had<br>
 told him that the man was dying. So this clerk was scheming
for<br>
 Marneffe's advancement.</p>

<p>When Hulot went through his anteroom, full of visitors, he
saw<br>
 Marneffe's colorless face in a corner, and sent for him before
any one<br>
 else.</p>

<p>"What do you want of me, my dear fellow?" said the Baron,
disguising<br>
 his anxiety.</p>

<p>"Monsieur le Directeur, I am the laughing-stock of the office,
for it<br>
 has become known that the chief of the clerks has left this
morning<br>
 for a holiday, on the ground of his health. He is to be away a
month.<br>
 Now, we all know what waiting for a month means. You deliver me
over<br>
 to the mockery of my enemies, and it is bad enough to be drummed
upon<br>
 one side; drumming on both at once, monsieur, is apt to burst
the<br>
 drum."</p>

<p>"My dear Marneffe, it takes long patience to gain an end. You
cannot<br>
 be made head-clerk in less than two months, if ever. Just when I
must,<br>
 as far as possible, secure my own position, is not the time to
be<br>
 applying for your promotion, which would raise a scandal."</p>

<p>"If you are broke, I shall never get it," said Marneffe
coolly. "And<br>
 if you get me the place, it will make no difference in the
end."</p>

<p>"Then I am to sacrifice myself for you?" said the Baron.</p>

<p>"If you do not, I shall be much mistaken in you."</p>

<p>"You are too exclusively Marneffe, Monsieur Marneffe," said
Hulot,<br>
 rising and showing the clerk the door.</p>

<p>"I have the honor to wish you good-morning, Monsieur le
Baron," said<br>
 Marneffe humbly.</p>

<p>"What an infamous rascal!" thought the Baron. "This is
uncommonly like<br>
 a summons to pay within twenty-four hours on pain of
distraint."</p>

<p>Two hours later, just when the Baron had been instructing
Claude<br>
 Vignon, whom he was sending to the Ministry of Justice to
obtain<br>
 information as to the judicial authorities under whose
jurisdiction<br>
 Johann Fischer might fall, Reine opened the door of his private
room<br>
 and gave him a note, saying she would wait for the answer.</p>

<p>"Valerie is mad!" said the Baron to himself. "To send Reine!
It is<br>
 enough to compromise us all, and it certainly compromises
that<br>
 dreadful Marneffe's chances of promotion!"</p>

<p>But he dismissed the minister's private secretary, and read
as<br>
 follows:--</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Oh, my dear friend, what a scene I have had to endure! Though
you<br>
 have made me happy for three years, I have paid dearly for it!
He<br>
 came in from the office in a rage that made me quake. I knew
he<br>
 was ugly; I have seen him a monster! His four real teeth<br>
 chattered, and he threatened me with his odious presence
without<br>
 respite if I should continue to receive you. My poor, dear
old<br>
 boy, our door is closed against you henceforth. You see my
tears;<br>
 they are dropping on the paper and soaking it; can you read what
I<br>
 write, dear Hector? Oh, to think of never seeing you, of
giving<br>
 you up when I bear in me some of your life, as I flatter myself
I<br>
 have your heart--it is enough to kill me. Think of our
little<br>
 Hector!</p>

<p>"Do not forsake me, but do not disgrace yourself for
Marneffe's<br>
 sake; do not yield to his threats.</p>

<p>"I love you as I have never loved! I remember all the
sacrifices<br>
 you have made for your Valerie; she is not, and never will
be,<br>
 ungrateful; you are, and will ever be, my only husband. Think
no<br>
 more of the twelve hundred francs a year I asked you to settle
on<br>
 the dear little Hector who is to come some months hence; I
will<br>
 not cost you anything more. And besides, my money will always
be<br>
 yours.</p>

<p><br>
 "Oh, if you only loved me as I love you, my Hector, you
would<br>
 retire on your pension; we should both take leave of our
family,<br>
 our worries, our surroundings, so full of hatred, and we should
go<br>
 to live with Lisbeth in some pretty country place--in Brittany,
or<br>
 wherever you like. There we should see nobody, and we should
be<br>
 happy away from the world. Your pension and the little property
I<br>
 can call my own would be enough for us. You say you are
jealous;<br>
 well, you would then have your Valerie entirely devoted to
her<br>
 Hector, and you would never have to talk in a loud voice, as
you<br>
 did the other day. I shall have but one child--ours--you may
be<br>
 sure, my dearly loved old veteran.</p>

<p>"You cannot conceive of my fury, for you cannot know how
he<br>
 treated me, and the foul words he vomited on your Valerie.
Such<br>
 words would disgrace my paper; a woman such as I
am--Montcornet's<br>
 daughter--ought never to have heard one of them in her life.
I<br>
 only wish you had been there, that I might have punished him
with<br>
 the sight of the mad passion I felt for you. My father would
have<br>
 killed the wretch; I can only do as women do--love you
devotedly!<br>
 Indeed, my love, in the state of exasperation in which I am,
I<br>
 cannot possibly give up seeing you. I must positively see you,
in<br>
 secret, every day! That is what we are, we women. Your
resentment<br>
 is mine. If you love me, I implore you, do not let him be<br>
 promoted; leave him to die a second-class clerk.</p>

<p>"At this moment I have lost my head; I still seem to hear
him<br>
 abusing me. Betty, who had meant to leave me, has pity on me,
and<br>
 will stay for a few days.</p>

<p>"My dear kind love, I do not know yet what is to be done. I
see<br>
 nothing for it but flight. I always delight in the country--<br>
 Brittany, Languedoc, what you will, so long as I am free to
love<br>
 you. Poor dear, how I pity you! Forced now to go back to your
old<br>
 Adeline, to that lachrymal urn--for, as he no doubt told you,
the<br>
 monster means to watch me night and day; he spoke of a
detective!<br>
 Do not come here, he is capable of anything I know, since he
could<br>
 make use of me for the basest purposes of speculation. I only
wish<br>
 I could return you all the things I have received from your<br>
 generosity.</p>

<p>"Ah! my kind Hector, I may have flirted, and have seemed to
you to<br>
 be fickle, but you did not know your Valerie; she liked to
tease<br>
 you, but she loves you better than any one in the world.</p>

<p>"He cannot prevent your coming to see your cousin; I will
arrange<br>
 with her that we have speech with each other. My dear old
boy,<br>
 write me just a line, pray, to comfort me in the absence of
your<br>
 dear self. (Oh, I would give one of my hands to have you by me
on<br>
 our sofa!) A letter will work like a charm; write me
something<br>
 full of your noble soul; I will return your note to you, for
I<br>
 must be cautious; I should not know where to hide it, he pokes
his<br>
 nose in everywhere. In short, comfort your Valerie, your
little<br>
 wife, the mother of your child.--To think of my having to write
to<br>
 you, when I used to see you every day. As I say to Lisbeth, 'I
did<br>
 not know how happy I was.' A thousand kisses, dear boy. Be true
to<br>
 your</p>

<p>"VALERIE."</p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
 "And tears!" said Hulot to himself as he finished this letter,
"tears<br>
 which have blotted out her name.--How is she?" said he to
Reine.</p>

<p>"Madame is in bed; she has dreadful spasms," replied Reine.
"She had a<br>
 fit of hysterics that twisted her like a withy round a faggot.
It came<br>
 on after writing. It comes of crying so much. She heard
monsieur's<br>
 voice on the stairs."</p>

<p><br>
 The Baron in his distress wrote the following note on office
paper<br>
 with a printed heading:--</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Be quite easy, my angel, he will die a second-class
clerk!--Your<br>
 idea is admirable; we will go and live far from Paris, where
we<br>
 shall be happy with our little Hector; I will retire on my<br>
 pension, and I shall be sure to find some good appointment on
a<br>
 railway.</p>

<p>"Ah, my sweet friend, I feel so much the younger for your
letter!<br>
 I shall begin life again and make a fortune, you will see, for
our<br>
 dear little one. As I read your letter, a thousand times
more<br>
 ardent than those of the <i>Nouvelle Heloise</i>, it worked a
miracle!<br>
 I had not believed it possible that I could love you more.
This<br>
 evening, at Lisbeth's you will see</p>

<p>"YOUR HECTOR, FOR LIFE."</p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
 Reine carried off this reply, the first letter the Baron had
written<br>
 to his "sweet friend." Such emotions to some extent
counterbalanced<br>
 the disasters growling in the distance; but the Baron, at this
moment<br>
 believing he could certainly avert the blows aimed at his
uncle,<br>
 Johann Fischer, thought only of the deficit.</p>

<p><br>
 One of the characteristics of the Bonapartist temperament is a
firm<br>
 belief in the power of the sword, and confidence in the
superiority of<br>
 the military over civilians. Hulot laughed to scorn the
Public<br>
 Prosecutor in Algiers, where the War Office is supreme. Man is
always<br>
 what he has once been. How can the officers of the Imperial
Guard<br>
 forget that time was when the mayors of the largest towns in
the<br>
 Empire and the Emperor's prefects, Emperors themselves on a
minute<br>
 scale, would come out to meet the Imperial Guard, to pay
their<br>
 respects on the borders of the Departments through which it
passed,<br>
 and to do it, in short, the homage due to sovereigns?</p>

<p>At half-past four the baron went straight to Madame
Marneffe's; his<br>
 heart beat as high as a young man's as he went upstairs, for he
was<br>
 asking himself this question, "Shall I see her? or shall I
not?"</p>

<p>How was he now to remember the scene of the morning when his
weeping<br>
 children had knelt at his feet? Valerie's note, enshrined for
ever in<br>
 a thin pocket-book over his heart, proved to him that she loved
him<br>
 more than the most charming of young men.</p>

<p>Having rung, the unhappy visitor heard within the shuffling
slippers<br>
 and vexatious scraping cough of the detestable master. Marneffe
opened<br>
 the door, but only to put himself into an attitude and point to
the<br>
 stairs, exactly as Hulot had shown him the door of his private
room.</p>

<p>"You are too exclusively Hulot, Monsieur Hulot!" said he.</p>

<p>The Baron tried to pass him, Marneffe took a pistol out of his
pocket<br>
 and cocked it.</p>

<p>"Monsieur le Baron," said he, "when a man is as vile as I
am--for you<br>
 think me very vile, don't you?--he would be the meanest
galley-slave<br>
 if he did not get the full benefit of his betrayed honor.--You
are for<br>
 war; it will be hot work and no quarter. Come here no more, and
do not<br>
 attempt to get past me. I have given the police notice of my
position<br>
 with regard to you."</p>

<p>And taking advantage of Hulot's amazement, he pushed him out
and shut<br>
 the door.</p>

<p>"What a low scoundrel!" said Hulot to himself, as he went
upstairs to<br>
 Lisbeth. "I understand her letter now. Valerie and I will go
away from<br>
 Paris. Valerie is wholly mine for the remainder of my days; she
will<br>
 close my eyes."</p>

<p>Lisbeth was out. Madame Olivier told the Baron that she had
gone to<br>
 his wife's house, thinking that she would find him there.</p>

<p>"Poor thing! I should never have expected her to be so sharp
as she<br>
 was this morning," thought Hulot, recalling Lisbeth's behavior
as he<br>
 made his way from the Rue Vanneau to the Rue Plumet.</p>

<p>As he turned the corner of the Rue Vanneau and the Rue de
Babylone, he<br>
 looked back at the Eden whence Hymen had expelled him with the
sword<br>
 of the law. Valerie, at her window, was watching his departure;
as he<br>
 glanced up, she waved her handkerchief, but the rascally
Marneffe hit<br>
 his wife's cap and dragged her violently away from the window. A
tear<br>
 rose to the great official's eye.</p>

<p>"Oh! to be so well loved! To see a woman so ill used, and to
be so<br>
 nearly seventy years old!" thought he.</p>

<p>Lisbeth had come to give the family the good news. Adeline
and<br>
 Hortense had already heard that the Baron, not choosing to
compromise<br>
 himself in the eyes of the whole office by appointing Marneffe
to the<br>
 first class, would be turned from the door by the
Hulot-hating<br>
 husband. Adeline, very happy, had ordered a dinner that her
Hector was<br>
 to like better than any of Valerie's; and Lisbeth, in her
devotion,<br>
 was helping Mariette to achieve this difficult result. Cousin
Betty<br>
 was the idol of the hour. Mother and daughter kissed her hands,
and<br>
 had told her with touching delight that the Marshal consented to
have<br>
 her as his housekeeper.</p>

<p>"And from that, my dear, there is but one step to becoming his
wife!"<br>
 said Adeline.</p>

<p>"In fact, he did not say no when Victorin mentioned it," added
the<br>
 Countess.</p>

<p>The Baron was welcomed home with such charming proofs of
affection, so<br>
 pathetically overflowing with love, that he was fain to conceal
his<br>
 troubles.</p>

<p>Marshal Hulot came to dinner. After dinner, Hector did not go
out.<br>
 Victorin and his wife joined them, and they made up a
rubber.</p>

<p>"It is a long time, Hector, said the Marshal gravely, "since
you gave<br>
 us the treat of such an evening."</p>

<p>This speech from the old soldier, who spoiled his brother
though he<br>
 thus implicitly blamed him, made a deep impression. It showed
how wide<br>
 and deep were the wounds in a heart where all the woes he had
divined<br>
 had found an echo. At eight o'clock the Baron insisted on
seeing<br>
 Lisbeth home, promising to return.</p>

<p>"Do you know, Lisbeth, he ill-treats her!" said he in the
street. "Oh,<br>
 I never loved her so well!"</p>

<p>"I never imagined that Valerie loved you so well," replied
Lisbeth.<br>
 "She is frivolous and a coquette, she loves to have attentions
paid<br>
 her, and to have the comedy of love-making performed for her, as
she<br>
 says; but you are her only real attachment."</p>

<p>"What message did she send me?"</p>

<p>"Why, this," said Lisbeth. "She has, as you know, been on
intimate<br>
 terms with Crevel. You must owe her no grudge, for that, in
fact, is<br>
 what has raised her above utter poverty for the rest of her
life; but<br>
 she detests him, and matters are nearly at an end.--Well, she
has kept<br>
 the key of some rooms--"</p>

<p>"Rue du Dauphin!" cried the thrice-blest Baron. "If it were
for that<br>
 alone, I would overlook Crevel.--I have been there; I know."</p>

<p>"Here, then, is the key," said Lisbeth. "Have another made
from it in<br>
 the course of to-morrow--two if you can."</p>

<p>"And then," said Hulot eagerly.</p>

<p>"Well, I will dine at your house again to-morrow; you must
give me<br>
 back Valerie's key, for old Crevel might ask her to return it to
him,<br>
 and you can meet her there the day after; then you can decide
what<br>
 your facts are to be. You will be quite safe, as there are two
ways<br>
 out. If by chance Crevel, who is <i>Regence</i> in his habits,
as he is<br>
 fond of saying, should come in by the side street, you could go
out<br>
 through the shop, or <i>vice versa.</i></p>

<p>"You owe all this to me, you old villain; now what will you do
for<br>
 me?"</p>

<p>"Whatever you want."</p>

<p>"Then you will not oppose my marrying your brother?"</p>

<p>"You! the Marechale Hulot, the Comtesse de Frozheim?" cried
Hector,<br>
 startled.</p>

<p>"Well, Adeline is a Baroness!" retorted Betty in a vicious
and<br>
 formidable tone. "Listen to me, you old libertine. You know
how<br>
 matters stand; your family may find itself starving in the
gutter--"</p>

<p>"That is what I dread," said Hulot in dismay.</p>

<p>"And if your brother were to die, who would maintain your wife
and<br>
 daughter? The widow of a Marshal gets at least six thousand
francs<br>
 pension, doesn't she? Well, then, I wish to marry to secure
bread for<br>
 your wife and daughter--old dotard!"</p>

<p>"I had not seen it in that light!" said the Baron. "I will
talk to my<br>
 brother--for we are sure of you.--Tell my angel that my life is
hers."</p>

<p>And the Baron, having seen Lisbeth go into the house in the
Rue<br>
 Vanneau, went back to his whist and stayed at home. The Baroness
was<br>
 at the height of happiness; her husband seemed to be returning
to<br>
 domestic habits; for about a fortnight he went to his office at
nine<br>
 every morning, he came in to dinner at six, and spent the
evening with<br>
 his family. He twice took Adeline and Hortense to the play. The
mother<br>
 and daughter paid for three thanksgiving masses, and prayed to
God to<br>
 suffer them to keep the husband and father He had restored to
them.</p>

<p>One evening Victorin Hulot, seeing his father retire for the
night,<br>
 said to his mother:</p>

<p>"Well, we are at any rate so far happy that my father has come
back to<br>
 us. My wife and I shall never regret our capital if only this
lasts--"</p>

<p>"Your father is nearly seventy," said the Baroness. "He still
thinks<br>
 of Madame Marneffe, that I can see; but he will forget her in
time. A<br>
 passion for women is not like gambling, or speculation, or
avarice;<br>
 there is an end to it."</p>

<p>But Adeline, still beautiful in spite of her fifty years and
her<br>
 sorrows, in this was mistaken. Profligates, men whom Nature has
gifted<br>
 with the precious power of loving beyond the limits ordinarily
set to<br>
 love, rarely are as old as their age.</p>

<p>During this relapse into virtue Baron Hulot had been three
times to<br>
 the Rue du Dauphin, and had certainly not been the man of
seventy. His<br>
 rekindled passion made him young again, and he would have
sacrificed<br>
 his honor to Valerie, his family, his all, without a regret.
But<br>
 Valerie, now completely altered, never mentioned money, not even
the<br>
 twelve hundred francs a year to be settled on their son; on
the<br>
 contrary, she offered him money, she loved Hulot as a woman of
six-<br>
 and-thirty loves a handsome law-student--a poor, poetical,
ardent boy.<br>
 And the hapless wife fancied she had reconquered her dear
Hector!</p>

<p>The fourth meeting between this couple had been agreed upon at
the end<br>
 of the third, exactly as formerly in Italian theatres the play
was<br>
 announced for the next night. The hour fixed was nine in the
morning.<br>
 On the next day when the happiness was due for which the amorous
old<br>
 man had resigned himself to domestic rules, at about eight in
the<br>
 morning, Reine came and asked to see the Baron. Hulot, fearing
some<br>
 catastrophe, went out to speak with Reine, who would not come
into the<br>
 anteroom. The faithful waiting-maid gave him the following
note:--</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"DEAR OLD MAN,--Do not go to the Rue du Dauphin. Our incubus
is<br>
 ill, and I must nurse him; but be there this evening at
nine.<br>
 Crevel is at Corbeil with Monsieur Lebas; so I am sure he
will<br>
 bring no princess to his little palace. I have made
arrangements<br>
 here to be free for the night and get back before Marneffe
is<br>
 awake. Answer me as to all this, for perhaps your long elegy of
a<br>
 wife no longer allows you your liberty as she did. I am told
she<br>
 is still so handsome that you might play me false, you are such
a<br>
 gay dog! Burn this note; I am suspicious of every one."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hulot wrote this scrap in reply:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"MY LOVE,--As I have told you, my wife has not for
five-and-twenty<br>
 years interfered with my pleasures. For you I would give up
a<br>
 hundred Adelines.--I will be in the Crevel sanctum at nine
this<br>
 evening awaiting my divinity. Oh that your clerk might soon
die!<br>
 We should part no more. And this is the dearest wish of</p>

<p>"YOUR HECTOR."</p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
 That evening the Baron told his wife that he had business with
the<br>
 Minister at Saint-Cloud, that he would come home at about four
or five<br>
 in the morning; and he went to the Rue du Dauphin. It was
towards the<br>
 end of the month of June.</p>

<p><br>
 Few men have in the course of their life known really the
dreadful<br>
 sensation of going to their death; those who have returned from
the<br>
 foot of the scaffold may be easily counted. But some have had a
vivid<br>
 experience of it in dreams; they have gone through it all, to
the<br>
 sensation of the knife at their throat, at the moment when
waking and<br>
 daylight come to release them.--Well, the sensation to which
the<br>
 Councillor of State was a victim at five in the morning in
Crevel's<br>
 handsome and elegant bed, was immeasurably worse than that of
feeling<br>
 himself bound to the fatal block in the presence of ten
thousand<br>
 spectators looking at you with twenty thousand sparks of
fire.</p>

<p>Valerie was asleep in a graceful attitude. She was lovely, as
a woman<br>
 is who is lovely enough to look so even in sleep. It is art
invading<br>
 nature; in short, a living picture.</p>

<p>In his horizontal position the Baron's eyes were but three
feet above<br>
 the floor. His gaze, wandering idly, as that of a man who is
just<br>
 awake and collecting his ideas, fell on a door painted with
flowers by<br>
 Jan, an artist disdainful of fame. The Baron did not indeed see
twenty<br>
 thousand flaming eyes, like the man condemned to death; he saw
but<br>
 one, of which the shaft was really more piercing than the
thousands on<br>
 the Public Square.</p>

<p>Now this sensation, far rarer in the midst of enjoyment even
than that<br>
 of a man condemned to death, was one for which many a
splenetic<br>
 Englishman would certainly pay a high price. The Baron lay
there,<br>
 horizontal still, and literally bathed in cold sweat. He tried
to<br>
 doubt the fact; but this murderous eye had a voice. A sound
of<br>
 whispering was heard through the door.</p>

<p>"So long as it is nobody but Crevel playing a trick on me!"
said the<br>
 Baron to himself, only too certain of an intruder in the
temple.</p>

<p>The door was opened. The Majesty of the French Law, which in
all<br>
 documents follows next to the King, became visible in the person
of a<br>
 worthy little police-officer supported by a tall Justice of the
Peace,<br>
 both shown in by Monsieur Marneffe. The police functionary,
rooted in<br>
 shoes of which the straps were tied together with flapping bows,
ended<br>
 at top in a yellow skull almost bare of hair, and a face
betraying him<br>
 as a wide-awake, cheerful, and cunning dog, from whom Paris life
had<br>
 no secrets. His eyes, though garnished with spectacles, pierced
the<br>
 glasses with a keen mocking glance. The Justice of the Peace,
a<br>
 retired attorney, and an old admirer of the fair sex, envied
the<br>
 delinquent.</p>

<p>"Pray excuse the strong measures required by our office,
Monsieur le<br>
 Baron!" said the constable; "we are acting for the plaintiff.
The<br>
 Justice of the Peace is here to authorize the visitation of
the<br>
 premises.--I know who you are, and who the lady is who is
accused."</p>

<p>Valerie opened her astonished eyes, gave such a shriek as
actresses<br>
 use to depict madness on the stage, writhed in convulsions on
the bed,<br>
 like a witch of the Middle Ages in her sulphur-colored frock on
a bed<br>
 of faggots.</p>

<p>"Death, and I am ready! my dear Hector--but a police
court?--Oh!<br>
 never."</p>

<p>With one bound she passed the three spectators and crouched
under the<br>
 little writing-table, hiding her face in her hands.</p>

<p>"Ruin! Death!" she cried.</p>

<p>"Monsieur," said Marneffe to Hulot, "if Madame Marneffe goes
mad, you<br>
 are worse than a profligate; you will be a murderer."</p>

<p>What can a man do, what can he say, when he is discovered in a
bed<br>
 which is not his, even on the score of hiring, with a woman who
is no<br>
 more his than the bed is?--Well, this:</p>

<p>"Monsieur the Justice of the Peace, Monsieur the Police
Officer," said<br>
 the Baron with some dignity, "be good enough to take proper care
of<br>
 that unhappy woman, whose reason seems to me to be in
danger.--You can<br>
 harangue me afterwards. The doors are locked, no doubt; you need
not<br>
 fear that she will get away, or I either, seeing the costume we
wear."</p>

<p>The two functionaries bowed to the magnate's injunctions.</p>

<p>"You, come here, miserable cur!" said Hulot in a low voice
to<br>
 Marneffe, taking him by the arm and drawing him closer. "It is
not I,<br>
 but you, who will be the murderer! You want to be head-clerk of
your<br>
 room and officer of the Legion of Honor?"</p>

<p>"That in the first place, Chief!" replied Marneffe, with a
bow.</p>

<p>"You shall be all that, only soothe your wife and dismiss
these<br>
 fellows."</p>

<p>"Nay, nay!" said Marneffe knowingly. "These gentlemen must
draw up<br>
 their report as eyewitnesses to the fact; without that, the
chief<br>
 evidence in my case, where should I be? The higher official
ranks are<br>
 chokeful of rascalities. You have done me out of my wife, and
you have<br>
 not promoted me, Monsieur le Baron; I give you only two days to
get<br>
 out of the scrape. Here are some letters--"</p>

<p>"Some letters!" interrupted Hulot.</p>

<p>"Yes; letters which prove that you are the father of the child
my wife<br>
 expects to give birth to.--You understand? And you ought to
settle on<br>
 my son a sum equal to what he will lose through this bastard.
But I<br>
 will be reasonable; this does not distress me, I have no mania
for<br>
 paternity myself. A hundred louis a year will satisfy me. By
to-morrow<br>
 I must be Monsieur Coquet's successor and see my name on the
list for<br>
 promotion in the Legion of Honor at the July fetes, or
else--the<br>
 documentary evidence and my charge against you will be laid
before the<br>
 Bench. I am not so hard to deal with after all, you see."</p>

<p>"Bless me, and such a pretty woman!" said the Justice of the
Peace to<br>
 the police constable. "What a loss to the world if she should go
mad!"</p>

<p>"She is not mad," said the constable sententiously. The police
is<br>
 always the incarnation of scepticism.--"Monsieur le Baron Hulot
has<br>
 been caught by a trick," he added, loud enough for Valerie to
hear<br>
 him.</p>

<p>Valerie shot a flash from her eye which would have killed him
on the<br>
 spot if looks could effect the vengeance they express. The
police-<br>
 officer smiled; he had laid a snare, and the woman had fallen
into it.<br>
 Marneffe desired his wife to go into the other room and clothe
herself<br>
 decently, for he and the Baron had come to an agreement on all
points,<br>
 and Hulot fetched his dressing-gown and came out again.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen," said he to the two officials, "I need not impress
on you<br>
 to be secret."</p>

<p>The functionaries bowed.</p>

<p>The police-officer rapped twice on the door; his clerk came
in, sat<br>
 down at the "bonheur-du-jour," and wrote what the constable
dictated<br>
 to him in an undertone. Valerie still wept vehemently. When she
was<br>
 dressed, Hulot went into the other room and put on his
clothes.<br>
 Meanwhile the report was written.</p>

<p>Marneffe then wanted to take his wife home; but Hulot,
believing that<br>
 he saw her for the last time, begged the favor of being allowed
to<br>
 speak with her.</p>

<p>"Monsieur, your wife has cost me dear enough for me to be
allowed to<br>
 say good-bye to her--in the presence of you all, of course."</p>

<p>Valerie went up to Hulot, and he whispered in her ear:</p>

<p>"There is nothing left for us but to fly, but how can we
correspond?<br>
 We have been betrayed--"</p>

<p>"Through Reine," she answered. "But my dear friend, after this
scandal<br>
 we can never meet again. I am disgraced. Besides, you will
hear<br>
 dreadful things about me--you will believe them--"</p>

<p>The Baron made a gesture of denial.</p>

<p>"You will believe them, and I can thank God for that, for then
perhaps<br>
 you will not regret me."</p>

<p>"He will <i>not</i> die a second-class clerk!" said Marneffe
to Hulot, as<br>
 he led his wife away, saying roughly, "Come, madame; if I am
foolish<br>
 to you, I do not choose to be a fool to others."</p>

<p>Valerie left the house, Crevel's Eden, with a last glance at
the<br>
 Baron, so cunning that he thought she adored him. The Justice of
the<br>
 Peace gave Madame Marneffe his arm to the hackney coach with
a<br>
 flourish of gallantry. The Baron, who was required to witness
the<br>
 report, remained quite bewildered, alone with the
police-officer. When<br>
 the Baron had signed, the officer looked at him keenly, over
his<br>
 glasses.</p>

<p>"You are very sweet on the little lady, Monsieur le
Baron?"</p>

<p>"To my sorrow, as you see."</p>

<p>"Suppose that she does not care for you?" the man went on,
"that she<br>
 is deceiving you?"</p>

<p>"I have long known that, monsieur--here, in this very spot,
Monsieur<br>
 Crevel and I told each other----"</p>

<p>"Oh! Then you knew that you were in Monsieur le Maire's
private<br>
 snuggery?"</p>

<p>"Perfectly."</p>

<p>The constable lightly touched his hat with a respectful
gesture.</p>

<p>"You are very much in love," said he. "I say no more. I
respect an<br>
 inveterate passion, as a doctor respects an inveterate
complaint.--I<br>
 saw Monsieur de Nucingen, the banker, attacked in the same
way--"</p>

<p>"He is a friend of mine," said the Baron. "Many a time have I
supped<br>
 with his handsome Esther. She was worth the two million francs
she<br>
 cost him."</p>

<p>"And more," said the officer. "That caprice of the old Baron's
cost<br>
 four persons their lives. Oh! such passions as these are like
the<br>
 cholera!"</p>

<p>"What had you to say to me?" asked the Baron, who took this
indirect<br>
 warning very ill.</p>

<p>"Oh! why should I deprive you of your illusions?" replied the
officer.<br>
 "Men rarely have any left at your age!"</p>

<p>"Rid me of them!" cried the Councillor.</p>

<p>"You will curse the physician later," replied the officer,
smiling.</p>

<p>"I beg of you, monsieur."</p>

<p>"Well, then, that woman was in collusion with her
husband."</p>

<p>"Oh!----"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, and so it is in two cases out of every ten. Oh! we
know it<br>
 well."</p>

<p>"What proof have you of such a conspiracy?"</p>

<p>"In the first place, the husband!" said the other, with the
calm<br>
 acumen of a surgeon practised in unbinding wounds. "Mean
speculation<br>
 is stamped in every line of that villainous face. But you, no
doubt,<br>
 set great store by a certain letter written by that woman with
regard<br>
 to the child?"</p>

<p>"So much so, that I always have it about me," replied Hulot,
feeling<br>
 in his breast-pocket for the little pocketbook which he always
kept<br>
 there.</p>

<p>"Leave your pocketbook where it is," said the man, as crushing
as a<br>
 thunder-clap. "Here is the letter.--I now know all I want to
know.<br>
 Madame Marneffe, of course, was aware of what that
pocketbook<br>
 contained?"</p>

<p>"She alone in the world."</p>

<p>"So I supposed.--Now for the proof you asked for of her
collusion with<br>
 her husband."</p>

<p>"Let us hear!" said the Baron, still incredulous.</p>

<p>"When we came in here, Monsieur le Baron, that wretched
creature<br>
 Marneffe led the way, and he took up this letter, which his
wife, no<br>
 doubt, had placed on this writing-table," and he pointed to
the<br>
 <i>bonheur-du-jour</i>. "That evidently was the spot agreed upon
by the<br>
 couple, in case she should succeed in stealing the letter while
you<br>
 were asleep; for this letter, as written to you by the lady,
is,<br>
 combined with those you wrote to her, decisive evidence in a
police-<br>
 court."</p>

<p><br>
 He showed Hulot the note that Reine had delivered to him in
his<br>
 private room at the office.</p>

<p>"It is one of the documents in the case," said the
police-agent;<br>
 "return it to me, monsieur."</p>

<p>"Well, monsieur," replied Hulot with bitter expression, "that
woman is<br>
 profligacy itself in fixed ratios. I am certain at this moment
that<br>
 she has three lovers."</p>

<p>"That is perfectly evident," said the officer. "Oh, they are
not all<br>
 on the streets! When a woman follows that trade in a carriage
and a<br>
 drawing-room, and her own house, it is not a case for francs
and<br>
 centimes, Monsieur le Baron. Mademoiselle Esther, of whom you
spoke,<br>
 and who poisoned herself, made away with millions.--If you will
take<br>
 my advice, you will get out of it, monsieur. This last little
game<br>
 will have cost you dear. That scoundrel of a husband has the law
on<br>
 his side. And indeed, but for me, that little woman would have
caught<br>
 you again!"</p>

<p>"Thank you, monsieur," said the Baron, trying to maintain his
dignity.</p>

<p>"Now we will lock up; the farce is played out, and you can
send your<br>
 key to Monsieur the Mayor."</p>

<p>Hulot went home in a state of dejection bordering on
helplessness, and<br>
 sunk in the gloomiest thoughts. He woke his noble and saintly
wife,<br>
 and poured into her heart the history of the past three years,
sobbing<br>
 like a child deprived of a toy. This confession from an old man
young<br>
 in feeling, this frightful and heart-rending narrative, while
it<br>
 filled Adeline with pity, also gave her the greatest joy; she
thanked<br>
 Heaven for this last catastrophe, for in fancy she saw the
husband<br>
 settled at last in the bosom of his family.</p>

<p>"Lisbeth was right," said Madame Hulot gently and without any
useless<br>
 recrimination, "she told us how it would be."</p>

<p>"Yes. If only I had listened to her, instead of flying into a
rage,<br>
 that day when I wanted poor Hortense to go home rather than
compromise<br>
 the reputation of that--Oh! my dear Adeline, we must save
Wenceslas.<br>
 He is up to his chin in that mire!"</p>

<p>"My poor old man, the respectable middle-classes have turned
out no<br>
 better than the actresses," said Adeline, with a smile.</p>

<p>The Baroness was alarmed at the change in her Hector; when she
saw him<br>
 so unhappy, ailing, crushed under his weight of woes, she was
all<br>
 heart, all pity, all love; she would have shed her blood to make
Hulot<br>
 happy.</p>

<p>"Stay with us, my dear Hector. Tell me what is it that such
women do<br>
 to attract you so powerfully. I too will try. Why have you not
taught<br>
 me to be what you want? Am I deficient in intelligence? Men
still<br>
 think me handsome enough to court my favor."</p>

<p>Many a married woman, attached to her duty and to her husband,
may<br>
 here pause to ask herself why strong and affectionate men, so
tender-<br>
 hearted to the Madame Marneffes, do not take their wives for
the<br>
 object of their fancies and passions, especially wives like
the<br>
 Baronne Adeline Hulot.</p>

<p>This is, indeed, one of the most recondite mysteries of human
nature.<br>
 Love, which is debauch of reason, the strong and austere joy of
a<br>
 lofty soul, and pleasure, the vulgar counterfeit sold in the
market-<br>
 place, are two aspects of the same thing. The woman who can
satisfy<br>
 both these devouring appetites is as rare in her sex as a
great<br>
 general, a great writer, a great artist, a great inventor in a
nation.<br>
 A man of superior intellect or an idiot--a Hulot or a
Crevel--equally<br>
 crave for the ideal and for enjoyment; all alike go in search of
the<br>
 mysterious compound, so rare that at last it is usually found to
be a<br>
 work in two volumes. This craving is a depraved impulse due
to<br>
 society.</p>

<p>Marriage, no doubt, must be accepted as a tie; it is life,
with its<br>
 duties and its stern sacrifices on both parts equally.
Libertines, who<br>
 seek for hidden treasure, are as guilty as other evil-doers who
are<br>
 more hardly dealt with than they. These reflections are not a
mere<br>
 veneer of moralizing; they show the reason of many
unexplained<br>
 misfortunes. But, indeed, this drama points its own moral--or
morals,<br>
 for they are of many kinds.</p>

<p>The Baron presently went to call on the Marshal Prince de
Wissembourg,<br>
 whose powerful patronage was now his only chance. Having dwelt
under<br>
 his protection for five-and-thirty years, he was a visitor at
all<br>
 hours, and would be admitted to his rooms as soon as he was
up.</p>

<p>"Ah! How are you, my dear Hector?" said the great and worthy
leader.<br>
 "What is the matter? You look anxious. And yet the session is
ended.<br>
 One more over! I speak of that now as I used to speak of a
campaign.<br>
 And indeed I believe the newspapers nowadays speak of the
sessions as<br>
 parliamentary campaigns."</p>

<p>"We have been in difficulties, I must confess, Marshal; but
the times<br>
 are hard!" said Hulot. "It cannot be helped; the world was made
so.<br>
 Every phase has its own drawbacks. The worst misfortunes in the
year<br>
 1841 is that neither the King nor the ministers are free to act
as<br>
 Napoleon was."</p>

<p>The Marshal gave Hulot one of those eagle flashes which in its
pride,<br>
 clearness, and perspicacity showed that, in spite of years, that
lofty<br>
 soul was still upright and vigorous.</p>

<p>"You want me to so something for you?" said he, in a hearty
tone.</p>

<p>"I find myself under the necessity of applying to you for
the<br>
 promotion of one of my second clerks to the head of a room--as
a<br>
 personal favor to myself--and his advancement to be officer of
the<br>
 Legion of Honor."</p>

<p>"What is his name?" said the Marshal, with a look like a
lightning<br>
 flash.</p>

<p>"Marneffe."</p>

<p>"He has a pretty wife; I saw her on the occasion of your
daughter's<br>
 marriage.--If Roger--but Roger is away!--Hector, my boy, this
is<br>
 concerned with your pleasures. What, you still indulge--? Well,
you<br>
 are a credit to the old Guard. That is what comes of having been
in<br>
 the Commissariat; you have reserves!--But have nothing to do
with this<br>
 little job, my dear boy; it is too strong of the petticoat to be
good<br>
 business."</p>

<p>"No, Marshal; it is bad business, for the police courts have a
finger<br>
 in it. Would you like to see me go there?"</p>

<p>"The devil!" said the Prince uneasily. "Go on!"</p>

<p>"Well, I am in the predicament of a trapped fox. You have
always been<br>
 so kind to me, that you will, I am sure, condescend to help me
out of<br>
 the shameful position in which I am placed."</p>

<p>Hulot related his misadventures, as wittily and as lightly as
he<br>
 could.</p>

<p>"And you, Prince, will you allow my brother to die of grief, a
man you<br>
 love so well; or leave one of your staff in the War Office,
a<br>
 Councillor of State, to live in disgrace. This Marneffe is a
wretched<br>
 creature; he can be shelved in two or three years."</p>

<p>"How you talk of two or three years, my dear fellow!" said
the<br>
 Marshal.</p>

<p>"But, Prince, the Imperial Guard is immortal."</p>

<p>"I am the last of the first batch of Marshals," said the
Prince.<br>
 "Listen, Hector. You do not know the extent of my attachment to
you;<br>
 you shall see. On the day when I retire from office, we will
go<br>
 together. But you are not a Deputy, my friend. Many men want
your<br>
 place; but for me, you would be out of it by this time. Yes, I
have<br>
 fought many a pitched battle to keep you in it.--Well, I grant
you<br>
 your two requests; it would be too bad to see you riding the bar
at<br>
 your age and in the position you hold. But you stretch your
credit a<br>
 little too far. If this appointment gives rise to discussion, we
shall<br>
 not be held blameless. I can laugh at such things; but you will
find<br>
 it a thorn under your feet. And the next session will see
your<br>
 dismissal. Your place is held out as a bait to five or six
influential<br>
 men, and you have been enabled to keep it solely by the force of
my<br>
 arguments. I tell you, on the day when you retire, there will be
five<br>
 malcontents to one happy man; whereas, by keeping you hanging on
by a<br>
 thread for two or three years, we shall secure all six votes.
There<br>
 was a great laugh at the Council meeting; the Veteran of the
Old<br>
 Guard, as they say, was becoming desperately wide awake in<br>
 parliamentary tactics! I am frank with you.--And you are growing
gray;<br>
 you are a happy man to be able to get into such difficulties as
these!<br>
 How long is it since I--Lieutenant Cottin--had a mistress?"</p>

<p>He rang the bell.</p>

<p>"That police report must be destroyed," he added.</p>

<p>"Monseigneur, you are as a father to me! I dared not mention
my<br>
 anxiety on that point."</p>

<p>"I still wish I had Roger here," cried the Prince, as
Mitouflet, his<br>
 groom of the chambers, came in. "I was just going to send for
him!--<br>
 You may go, Mitouflet.--Go you, my dear old fellow, go and have
the<br>
 nomination made out; I will sign it. At the same time, that
low<br>
 schemer will not long enjoy the fruit of his crimes. He will
be<br>
 sharply watched, and drummed out of the regiment for the
smallest<br>
 fault.--You are saved this time, my dear Hector; take care for
the<br>
 future. Do not exhaust your friends' patience. You shall have
the<br>
 nomination this morning, and your man shall get his promotion in
the<br>
 Legion of Honor.--How old are you now?"</p>

<p>"Within three months of seventy."</p>

<p>"What a scapegrace!" said the Prince, laughing. "It is you who
deserve<br>
 a promotion, but, by thunder! we are not under Louis XV.!"</p>

<p>Such is the sense of comradeship that binds the glorious
survivors of<br>
 the Napoleonic phalanx, that they always feel as if they were in
camp<br>
 together, and bound to stand together through thick and
thin.</p>

<p>"One more favor such as this," Hulot reflected as he crossed
the<br>
 courtyard, "and I am done for!"</p>

<p>The luckless official went to Baron de Nucingen, to whom he
now owed a<br>
 mere trifle, and succeeded in borrowing forty thousand francs,
on his<br>
 salary pledged for two years more; the banker stipulated that in
the<br>
 event of Hulot's retirement on his pension, the whole of it
should be<br>
 devoted to the repayment of the sum borrowed till the capital
and<br>
 interest were all cleared off.</p>

<p>This new bargain, like the first, was made in the name of
Vauvinet, to<br>
 whom the Baron signed notes of hand to the amount of twelve
thousand<br>
 francs.</p>

<p>On the following day, the fateful police report, the husband's
charge,<br>
 the letters--all the papers--were destroyed. The scandalous
promotion<br>
 of Monsieur Marneffe, hardly heeded in the midst of the July
fetes,<br>
 was not commented on in any newspaper.</p>

<p>Lisbeth, to all appearance at war with Madame Marneffe, had
taken up<br>
 her abode with Marshal Hulot. Ten days after these events, the
banns<br>
 of marriage were published between the old maid and the
distinguished<br>
 old officer, to whom, to win his consent, Adeline had related
the<br>
 financial disaster that had befallen her Hector, begging him
never to<br>
 mention it to the Baron, who was, as she said, much saddened,
quite<br>
 depressed and crushed.</p>

<p>"Alas! he is as old as his years," she added.</p>

<p>So Lisbeth had triumphed. She was achieving the object of
her<br>
 ambition, she would see the success of her scheme, and her
hatred<br>
 gratified. She delighted in the anticipated joy of reigning
supreme<br>
 over the family who had so long looked down upon her. Yes, she
would<br>
 patronize her patrons, she would be the rescuing angel who would
dole<br>
 out a livelihood to the ruined family; she addressed herself
as<br>
 "Madame la Comtesse" and "Madame la Marechale," courtesying in
front<br>
 of a glass. Adeline and Hortense should end their days in
struggling<br>
 with poverty, while she, a visitor at the Tuileries, would lord
it in<br>
 the fashionable world.</p>

<p>A terrible disaster overthrew the old maid from the social
heights<br>
 where she so proudly enthroned herself.</p>

<p>On the very day when the banns were first published, the
Baron<br>
 received a second message from Africa. Another Alsatian
arrived,<br>
 handed him a letter, after assuring himself that he spoke to
Baron<br>
 Hulot, and after giving the Baron the address of his lodgings,
bowed<br>
 himself out, leaving the great man stricken by the opening lines
of<br>
 this letter:--</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"DEAR NEPHEW,--You will receive this letter, by my
calculations,<br>
 on the 7th of August. Supposing it takes you three days to send
us<br>
 the help we need, and that it is a fortnight on the way here,
that<br>
 brings us to the 1st of September.</p>

<p>"If you can act decisively within that time, you will have
saved<br>
 the honor and the life of yours sincerely, Johann Fischer.</p>

<p>"This is what I am required to demand by the clerk you have
made<br>
 my accomplice; for I am amenable, it would seem, to the law,
at<br>
 the Assizes, or before a council of war. Of course, you
understand<br>
 that Johann Fischer will never be brought to the bar of any<br>
 tribunal; he will go of his own act to appear at that of
God.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><br>
 "Your clerk seems to me a bad lot, quite capable of getting
you<br>
 into hot water; but he is as clever as any rogue. He says the
line<br>
 for you to take is to call out louder than any one, and to
send<br>
 out an inspector, a special commissioner, to discover who is<br>
 really guilty, rake up abuses, and make a fuss, in short; but
if<br>
 we stir up the struggle, who will stand between us and the
law?</p>

<p>"If your commissioner arrives here by the 1st of September,
and<br>
 you have given him your orders, sending by him two hundred<br>
 thousand francs to place in our storehouses the supplies we<br>
 profess to have secured in remote country places, we shall
be<br>
 absolutely solvent and regarded as blameless. You can trust
the<br>
 soldier who is the bearer of this letter with a draft in my
name<br>
 on a house in Algiers. He is a trustworthy fellow, a relation
of<br>
 mine, incapable of trying to find out what he is the bearer of.
I<br>
 have taken measures to guarantee the fellow's safe return. If
you<br>
 can do nothing, I am ready and willing to die for the man to
whom<br>
 we owe our Adeline's happiness!"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The anguish and raptures of passion and the catastrophe which
had<br>
 checked his career of profligacy had prevented Baron Hulot's
ever<br>
 thinking of poor Johann Fischer, though his first letter had
given<br>
 warning of the danger now become so pressing. The Baron went out
of<br>
 the dining-room in such agitation that he literally dropped on
to a<br>
 sofa in the drawing-room. He was stunned, sunk in the dull
numbness of<br>
 a heavy fall. He stared at a flower on the carpet, quite
unconscious<br>
 that he still held in his hand Johann's fatal letter.</p>

<p><br>
 Adeline, in her room, heard her husband throw himself on the
sofa,<br>
 like a lifeless mass; the noise was so peculiar that she fancied
he<br>
 had an apoplectic attack. She looked through the door at the
mirror,<br>
 in such dread as stops the breath and hinders motion, and she
saw her<br>
 Hector in the attitude of a man crushed. The Baroness stole in
on<br>
 tiptoe; Hector heard nothing; she went close up to him, saw
the<br>
 letter, took it, read it, trembling in every limb. She went
through<br>
 one of those violent nervous shocks that leave their traces for
ever<br>
 on the sufferer. Within a few days she became subject to a
constant<br>
 trembling, for after the first instant the need for action gave
her<br>
 such strength as can only be drawn from the very wellspring of
the<br>
 vital powers.</p>

<p>"Hector, come into my room," said she, in a voice that was no
more<br>
 than a breath. "Do not let your daughter see you in this state!
Come,<br>
 my dear, come!"</p>

<p>"Two hundred thousand francs? Where can I find them? I can get
Claude<br>
 Vignon sent out there as commissioner. He is a clever,
intelligent<br>
 fellow.--That is a matter of a couple of days.--But two
hundred<br>
 thousand francs! My son has not so much; his house is loaded
with<br>
 mortgages for three hundred thousand. My brother has saved
thirty<br>
 thousand francs at most. Nucingen would simply laugh at
me!--Vauvinet?<br>
 --he was not very ready to lend me the ten thousand francs I
wanted to<br>
 make up the sum for that villain Marneffe's boy. No, it is all
up with<br>
 me; I must throw myself at the Prince's feet, confess how
matters<br>
 stand, hear myself told that I am a low scoundrel, and take
his<br>
 broadside so as to go decently to the bottom."</p>

<p>"But, Hector, this is not merely ruin, it is disgrace," said
Adeline.<br>
 "My poor uncle will kill himself. Only kill us--yourself and me;
you<br>
 have a right to do that, but do not be a murderer! Come, take
courage;<br>
 there must be some way out of it."</p>

<p>"Not one," said Hulot. "No one in the Government could find
two<br>
 hundred thousand francs, not if it were to save an
Administration!--<br>
 Oh, Napoleon! where art thou?"</p>

<p>"My uncle! poor man! Hector, he must not be allowed to kill
himself in<br>
 disgrace."</p>

<p>"There is one more chance," said he, "but a very remote
one.--Yes,<br>
 Crevel is at daggers drawn with his daughter.--He has plenty of
money,<br>
 he alone could--"</p>

<p>"Listen, Hector it will be better for your wife to perish than
to<br>
 leave our uncle to perish--and your brother--the honor of the
family!"<br>
 cried the Baroness, struck by a flash of light. "Yes, I can save
you<br>
 all.--Good God! what a degrading thought! How could it have
occurred<br>
 to me?"</p>

<p>She clasped her hands, dropped on her knees, and put up a
prayer. On<br>
 rising, she saw such a crazy expression of joy on her husband's
face,<br>
 that the diabolical suggestion returned, and then Adeline sank
into a<br>
 sort of idiotic melancholy.</p>

<p>"Go, my dear, at once to the War Office," said she, rousing
herself<br>
 from this torpor; "try to send out a commission; it must be
done. Get<br>
 round the Marshal. And on your return, at five o'clock, you will
find<br>
 --perhaps--yes! you shall find two hundred thousand francs.
Your<br>
 family, your honor as a man, as a State official, a Councillor
of<br>
 State, your honesty--your son--all shall be saved;--but your
Adeline<br>
 will be lost, and you will see her no more. Hector, my dear,"
said<br>
 she, kneeling before him, clasping and kissing his hand, "give
me your<br>
 blessing! Say farewell."</p>

<p>It was so heart-rending that Hulot put his arms round his
wife, raised<br>
 her and kissed her, saying:</p>

<p>"I do not understand."</p>

<p>"If you did," said she, "I should die of shame, or I should
not have<br>
 the strength to carry out this last sacrifice."</p>

<p>"Breakfast is served," said Mariette.</p>

<p>Hortense came in to wish her parents good-morning. They had to
go to<br>
 breakfast and assume a false face.</p>

<p>"Begin without me; I will join you," said the Baroness.</p>

<p>She sat down to her desk and wrote as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"MY DEAR MONSIEUR CREVEL,--I have to ask a service of you; I
shall<br>
 expect you this morning, and I count on your gallantry, which
is<br>
 well known to me, to save me from having too long to wait for
you.<br>
 --Your faithful servant,</p>

<p>"ADELINE HULOT."</p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
 "Louise," said she to her daughter's maid, who waited on her,
"take<br>
 this note down to the porter and desire him to carry it at once
to<br>
 this address and wait for an answer."</p>

<p><br>
 The Baron, who was reading the news, held out a Republican paper
to<br>
 his wife, pointing to an article, and saying:</p>

<p>"Is there time?"</p>

<p>This was the paragraph, one of the terrible "notes" with which
the<br>
 papers spice their political bread and butter:--</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"A correspondent in Algiers writes that such abuses have
been<br>
 discovered in the commissariate transactions of the province
of<br>
 Oran, that the Law is making inquiries. The peculation is
self-<br>
 evident, and the guilty persons are known. If severe measures
are<br>
 not taken, we shall continue to lose more men through the<br>
 extortion that limits their rations than by Arab steel or
the<br>
 fierce heat of the climate. We await further information
before<br>
 enlarging on this deplorable business. We need no longer wonder
at<br>
 the terror caused by the establishment of the Press in Africa,
as<br>
 was contemplated by the Charter of 1830."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>"I will dress and go to the Minister," said the Baron, as they
rose<br>
 from table. "Time is precious; a man's life hangs on every
minute."</p>

<p>"Oh, mamma, there is no hope for me!" cried Hortense. And
unable to<br>
 check her tears, she handed to her mother a number of the
<i>Revue des<br>
 Beaux Arts.</i></p>

<p><br>
 Madame Hulot's eye fell on a print of the group of "Delilah" by
Count<br>
 Steinbock, under which were the words, "The property of
Madame<br>
 Marneffe."</p>

<p>The very first lines of the article, signed V., showed the
talent and<br>
 friendliness of Claude Vignon.</p>

<p>"Poor child!" said the Baroness.</p>

<p>Alarmed by her mother's tone of indifference, Hortense looked
up, saw<br>
 the expression of a sorrow before which her own paled, and rose
to<br>
 kiss her mother, saying:</p>

<p>"What is the matter, mamma? What is happening? Can we be more
wretched<br>
 than we are already?"</p>

<p>"My child, it seems to me that in what I am going through
to-day my<br>
 past dreadful sorrows are as nothing. When shall I have ceased
to<br>
 suffer?"</p>

<p>"In heaven, mother," said Hortense solemnly.</p>

<p>"Come, my angel, help me to dress.--No, no; I will not have
you help<br>
 me in this! Send me Louise."</p>

<p>Adeline, in her room, went to study herself in the glass. She
looked<br>
 at herself closely and sadly, wondering to herself:</p>

<p>"Am I still handsome? Can I still be desirable? Am I not
wrinkled?"</p>

<p>She lifted up her fine golden hair, uncovering her temples;
they were<br>
 as fresh as a girl's. She went further; she uncovered her
shoulders,<br>
 and was satisfied; nay, she had a little feeling of pride. The
beauty<br>
 of really handsome shoulders is one of the last charms a woman
loses,<br>
 especially if she has lived chastely.</p>

<p>Adeline chose her dress carefully, but the pious and blameless
woman<br>
 is decent to the end, in spite of her little coquettish graces.
Of<br>
 what use were brand-new gray silk stockings and high heeled
satin<br>
 shoes when she was absolutely ignorant of the art of displaying
a<br>
 pretty foot at a critical moment, by obtruding it an inch or
two<br>
 beyond a half-lifted skirt, opening horizons to desire? She put
on,<br>
 indeed, her prettiest flowered muslin dress, with a low body and
short<br>
 sleeves; but horrified at so much bareness, she covered her fine
arms<br>
 with clear gauze sleeves and hid her shoulders under an
embroidered<br>
 cape. Her curls, <i>a l'Anglaise</i>, struck her as too
fly-away; she<br>
 subdued their airy lightness by putting on a very pretty cap;
but,<br>
 with or without the cap, would she have known how to twist the
golden<br>
 ringlets so as to show off her taper fingers to admiration?</p>

<p>As to rouge--the consciousness of guilt, the preparations for
a<br>
 deliberate fall, threw this saintly woman into a state of high
fever,<br>
 which, for the time, revived the brilliant coloring of youth.
Her eyes<br>
 were bright, her cheeks glowed. Instead of assuming a seductive
air,<br>
 she saw in herself a look of barefaced audacity which shocked
her.</p>

<p>Lisbeth, at Adeline's request, had told her all the
circumstances of<br>
 Wenceslas' infidelity; and the Baroness had learned to her
utter<br>
 amazement, that in one evening in one moment, Madame Marneffe
had made<br>
 herself the mistress of the bewitched artist.</p>

<p>"How do these women do it?" the Baroness had asked
Lisbeth.</p>

<p>There is no curiosity so great as that of virtuous women on
such<br>
 subjects; they would like to know the arts of vice and
remain<br>
 immaculate.</p>

<p>"Why, they are seductive; it is their business," said Cousin
Betty.<br>
 "Valerie that evening, my dear, was, I declare, enough to bring
an<br>
 angel to perdition."</p>

<p>"But tell me how she set to work."</p>

<p>"There is no principle, only practice in that walk of life,"
said<br>
 Lisbeth ironically.</p>

<p>The Baroness, recalling this conversation, would have liked to
consult<br>
 Cousin Betty; but there was no time for that. Poor Adeline,
incapable<br>
 of imagining a patch, of pinning a rosebud in the very middle of
her<br>
 bosom, of devising the tricks of the toilet intended to
resuscitate<br>
 the ardors of exhausted nature, was merely well dressed. A woman
is<br>
 not a courtesan for the wishing!</p>

<p>"Woman is soup for man," as Moliere says by the mouth of the
judicious<br>
 Gros-Rene. This comparison suggests a sort of culinary art in
love.<br>
 Then the virtuous wife would be a Homeric meal, flesh laid on
hot<br>
 cinders. The courtesan, on the contrary, is a dish by Careme,
with its<br>
 condiments, spices, and elegant arrangement. The Baroness could
not--<br>
 did not know how to serve up her fair bosom in a lordly dish of
lace,<br>
 after the manner of Madame Marneffe. She knew nothing of the
secrets<br>
 of certain attitudes. This high-souled woman might have turned
round<br>
 and round a hundred times, and she would have betrayed nothing
to the<br>
 keen glance of a profligate.</p>

<p>To be a good woman and a prude to all the world, and a
courtesan to<br>
 her husband, is the gift of a woman of genius, and they are few.
This<br>
 is the secret of long fidelity, inexplicable to the women who
are not<br>
 blessed with the double and splendid faculty. Imagine Madame
Marneffe<br>
 virtuous, and you have the Marchesa di Pescara. But such lofty
and<br>
 illustrious women, beautiful as Diane de Poitiers, but virtuous,
may<br>
 be easily counted.</p>

<p>So the scene with which this serious and terrible drama of
Paris<br>
 manners opened was about to be repeated, with this singular
difference<br>
 --that the calamities prophesied then by the captain of the
municipal<br>
 Militia had reversed the parts. Madame Hulot was awaiting Crevel
with<br>
 the same intentions as had brought him to her, smiling down at
the<br>
 Paris crowd from his <i>milord</i>, three years ago. And,
strangest thing<br>
 of all, the Baroness was true to herself and to her love,
while<br>
 preparing to yield to the grossest infidelity, such as the storm
of<br>
 passion even does not justify in the eyes of some judges.</p>

<p>"What can I do to become a Madame Marneffe?" she asked herself
as she<br>
 heard the door-bell.</p>

<p>She restrained her tears, fever gave brilliancy to her face,
and she<br>
 meant to be quite the courtesan, poor, noble soul.</p>

<p>"What the devil can that worthy Baronne Hulot want of me?"
Crevel<br>
 wondered as he mounted the stairs. "She is going to discuss my
quarrel<br>
 with Celestine and Victorin, no doubt; but I will not give
way!"</p>

<p>As he went into the drawing-room, shown in by Louise, he said
to<br>
 himself as he noted the bareness of the place (Crevel's
word):</p>

<p>"Poor woman! She lives here like some fine picture stowed in a
loft by<br>
 a man who knows nothing of painting."</p>

<p>Crevel, seeing Comte Popinot, the Minister of Commerce, buy
pictures<br>
 and statues, wanted also to figure as a Maecenas of Paris, whose
love<br>
 of Art consists in making good investments.</p>

<p>Adeline smiled graciously at Crevel, pointing to a chair
facing her.</p>

<p>"Here I am, fair lady, at your command," said Crevel.</p>

<p>Monsieur the Mayor, a political personage, now wore black
broadcloth.<br>
 His face, at the top of this solemn suit, shone like a full
moon<br>
 rising above a mass of dark clouds. His shirt, buttoned with
three<br>
 large pearls worth five hundred francs apiece, gave a great idea
of<br>
 his thoracic capacity, and he was apt to say, "In me you see
the<br>
 coming athlete of the tribune!" His enormous vulgar hands were
encased<br>
 in yellow gloves even in the morning; his patent leather boots
spoke<br>
 of the chocolate-colored coupe with one horse in which he
drove.</p>

<p>In the course of three years ambition had altered Crevel's<br>
 pretensions. Like all great artists, he had come to his second
manner.<br>
 In the great world, when he went to the Prince de Wissembourg's,
to<br>
 the Prefecture, to Comte Popinot's, and the like, he held his
hat in<br>
 his hand in an airy manner taught him by Valerie, and he
inserted the<br>
 thumb of the other hand in the armhole of his waistcoat with a
knowing<br>
 air, and a simpering face and expression. This new grace of
attitude<br>
 was due to the satirical inventiveness of Valerie, who, under
pretence<br>
 of rejuvenating her mayor, had given him an added touch of
the<br>
 ridiculous.</p>

<p>"I begged you to come, my dear kind Monsieur Crevel," said
the<br>
 Baroness in a husky voice, "on a matter of the greatest
importance--"</p>

<p>"I can guess what it is, madame," said Crevel, with a knowing
air,<br>
 "but what you would ask is impossible.--Oh, I am not a brutal
father,<br>
 a man--to use Napoleon's words--set hard and fast on sheer
avarice.<br>
 Listen to me, fair lady. If my children were ruining themselves
for<br>
 their own benefit, I would help them out of the scrape; but as
for<br>
 backing your husband, madame? It is like trying to fill the vat
of the<br>
 Danaides! Their house is mortgaged for three hundred thousand
francs<br>
 for an incorrigible father! Why, they have nothing left,
poor<br>
 wretches! And they have no fun for their money. All they have to
live<br>
 upon is what Victorin may make in Court. He must wag his tongue
more,<br>
 must monsieur your son! And he was to have been a Minister,
that<br>
 learned youth! Our hope and pride. A pretty pilot, who runs
aground<br>
 like a land-lubber; for if he had borrowed to enable him to get
on, if<br>
 he had run into debt for feasting Deputies, winning votes,
and<br>
 increasing his influence, I should be the first to say, 'Here is
my<br>
 purse--dip your hand in, my friend!' But when it comes of paying
for<br>
 papa's folly--folly I warned you of!--Ah! his father has
deprived him<br>
 of every chance of power.--It is I who shall be Minister!"</p>

<p>"Alas, my dear Crevel, it has nothing to do with the children,
poor<br>
 devoted souls!--If your heart is closed to Victorin and
Celestine, I<br>
 shall love them so much that perhaps I may soften the bitterness
of<br>
 their souls caused by your anger. You are punishing your
children for<br>
 a good action!"</p>

<p>"Yes, for a good action badly done! That is half a crime,"
said<br>
 Crevel, much pleased with his epigram.</p>

<p>"Doing good, my dear Crevel, does not mean sparing money out
of a<br>
 purse that is bursting with it; it means enduring privations to
be<br>
 generous, suffering for liberality! It is being prepared for<br>
 ingratitude! Heaven does not see the charity that costs us
nothing--"</p>

<p>"Saints, madame, may if they please go to the workhouse; they
know<br>
 that it is for them the door of heaven. For my part, I am
worldly-<br>
 minded; I fear God, but yet more I fear the hell of poverty. To
be<br>
 destitute is the last depth of misfortune in society as now<br>
 constituted. I am a man of my time; I respect money."</p>

<p>"And you are right," said Adeline, "from the worldly point of
view."</p>

<p>She was a thousand miles from her point, and she felt herself
on a<br>
 gridiron, like Saint Laurence, as she thought of her uncle, for
she<br>
 could see him blowing his brains out.</p>

<p>She looked down; then she raised her eyes to gaze at Crevel
with<br>
 angelic sweetness--not with the inviting suggestiveness which
was part<br>
 of Valerie's wit. Three years ago she could have bewitched
Crevel by<br>
 that beautiful look.</p>

<p>"I have known the time," said she, "when you were more
generous--you<br>
 used to talk of three hundred thousand francs like a grand<br>
 gentleman--"</p>

<p>Crevel looked at Madame Hulot; he beheld her like a lily in
the last<br>
 of its bloom, vague sensations rose within him, but he felt
such<br>
 respect for this saintly creature that he spurned all suspicions
and<br>
 buried them in the most profligate corner of his heart.</p>

<p>"I, madame, am still the same; but a retired merchant, if he
is a<br>
 grand gentleman, plays, and must play, the part with method
and<br>
 economy; he carries his ideas of order into everything. He opens
an<br>
 account for his little amusements, and devotes certain profits
to that<br>
 head of expenditure; but as to touching his capital! it would
be<br>
 folly. My children will have their fortune intact, mine and my
wife's;<br>
 but I do not suppose that they wish their father to be dull, a
monk<br>
 and a mummy! My life is a very jolly one; I float gaily down
the<br>
 stream. I fulfil all the duties imposed on me by law, by my<br>
 affections, and by family ties, just as I always used to be
punctual<br>
 in paying my bills when they fell due. If only my children
conduct<br>
 themselves in their domestic life as I do, I shall be satisfied;
and<br>
 for the present, so long as my follies--for I have committed
follies--<br>
 are no loss to any one but the gulls--excuse me, you do not
perhaps<br>
 understand the slang word--they will have nothing to blame me
for, and<br>
 will find a tidy little sum still left when I die. Your
children<br>
 cannot say as much of their father, who is ruining his son and
my<br>
 daughter by his pranks--"</p>

<p><br>
 The Baroness was getting further from her object as he went
on.</p>

<p>"You are very unkind about my husband, my dear Crevel--and
yet, if you<br>
 had found his wife obliging, you would have been his best
friend----"</p>

<p>She shot a burning glance at Crevel; but, like Dubois, who
gave the<br>
 Regent three kicks, she affected too much, and the rakish
perfumer's<br>
 thoughts jumped at such profligate suggestions, that he said
to<br>
 himself, "Does she want to turn the tables on Hulot?--Does she
think<br>
 me more attractive as a Mayor than as a National Guardsman?
Women are<br>
 strange creatures!"</p>

<p>And he assumed the position of his second manner, looking at
the<br>
 Baroness with his <i>Regency</i> leer.</p>

<p>"I could almost fancy," she went on, "that you want to visit
on him<br>
 your resentment against the virtue that resisted you--in a woman
whom<br>
 you loved well enough--to--to buy her," she added in a low
voice.</p>

<p>"In a divine woman," Crevel replied, with a meaning smile at
the<br>
 Baroness, who looked down while tears rose to her eyes. "For you
have<br>
 swallowed not a few bitter pills!--in these three years--hey,
my<br>
 beauty?"</p>

<p>"Do not talk of my troubles, dear Crevel; they are too much
for the<br>
 endurance of a mere human being. Ah! if you still love me, you
may<br>
 drag me out of the pit in which I lie. Yes, I am in hell
torment! The<br>
 regicides who were racked and nipped and torn into quarters by
four<br>
 horses were on roses compared with me, for their bodies only
were<br>
 dismembered, and my heart is torn in quarters----"</p>

<p>Crevel's thumb moved from his armhole, he placed his hand on
the work-<br>
 table, he abandoned his attitude, he smiled! The smile was so
vacuous<br>
 that it misled the Baroness; she took it for an expression
of<br>
 kindness.</p>

<p>"You see a woman, not indeed in despair, but with her honor at
the<br>
 point of death, and prepared for everything, my dear friend, to
hinder<br>
 a crime."</p>

<p>Fearing that Hortense might come in, she bolted the door; then
with<br>
 equal impetuosity she fell at Crevel's feet, took his hand and
kissed<br>
 it.</p>

<p>"Be my deliverer!" she cried.</p>

<p>She thought there was some generous fibre in this mercantile
soul, and<br>
 full of sudden hope that she might get the two hundred thousand
francs<br>
 without degrading herself:</p>

<p>"Buy a soul--you were once ready to buy virtue!" she went on,
with a<br>
 frenzied gaze. "Trust to my honesty as a woman, to my honor, of
which<br>
 you know the worth! Be my friend! Save a whole family from
ruin,<br>
 shame, despair; keep it from falling into a bog where the
quicksands<br>
 are mingled with blood! Oh! ask for no explanations," she
exclaimed,<br>
 at a movement on Crevel's part, who was about to speak. "Above
all, do<br>
 not say to me, 'I told you so!' like a friend who is glad at
a<br>
 misfortune. Come now, yield to her whom you used to love, to the
woman<br>
 whose humiliation at your feet is perhaps the crowning moment of
her<br>
 glory; ask nothing of her, expect what you will from her
gratitude!--<br>
 No, no. Give me nothing, but lend--lend to me whom you used to
call<br>
 Adeline----"</p>

<p>At this point her tears flowed so fast, Adeline was sobbing
so<br>
 passionately, that Crevel's gloves were wet. The words, "I need
two<br>
 hundred thousand francs," were scarcely articulate in the
torrent of<br>
 weeping, as stones, however large, are invisible in Alpine
cataracts<br>
 swollen by the melting of the snows.</p>

<p>This is the inexperience of virtue. Vice asks for nothing, as
we have<br>
 seen in Madame Marneffe; it gets everything offered to it. Women
of<br>
 that stamp are never exacting till they have made themselves<br>
 indispensable, or when a man has to be worked as a quarry is
worked<br>
 where the lime is rather scarce--going to ruin, as the
quarry-men say.</p>

<p>On hearing these words, "Two hundred thousand francs,"
Crevel<br>
 understood all. He cheerfully raised the Baroness, saying
insolently:</p>

<p>"Come, come, bear up, mother," which Adeline, in her
distraction,<br>
 failed to hear. The scene was changing its character. Crevel
was<br>
 becoming "master of the situation," to use his own words. The
vastness<br>
 of the sum startled Crevel so greatly that his emotion at seeing
this<br>
 handsome woman in tears at his feet was forgotten. Besides,
however<br>
 angelical and saintly a woman may be, when she is crying
bitterly her<br>
 beauty disappears. A Madame Marneffe, as has been seen, whimpers
now<br>
 and then, a tear trickles down her cheek; but as to melting into
tears<br>
 and making her eyes and nose red!--never would she commit such
a<br>
 blunder.</p>

<p>"Come, child, compose yourself.--Deuce take it!" Crevel went
on,<br>
 taking Madame Hulot's hands in his own and patting them. "Why do
you<br>
 apply to me for two hundred thousand francs? What do you want
with<br>
 them? Whom are they for?"</p>

<p>"Do not," said she, "insist on any explanations. Give me the
money!--<br>
 You will save three lives and the honor of our children."</p>

<p>"And do you suppose, my good mother, that in all Paris you
will find a<br>
 man who at a word from a half-crazy woman will go off <i>hic et
nunc</i>,<br>
 and bring out of some drawer, Heaven knows where, two hundred
thousand<br>
 francs that have been lying simmering there till she is pleased
to<br>
 scoop them up? Is that all you know of life and of business,
my<br>
 beauty? Your folks are in a bad way; you may send them the
last<br>
 sacraments; for no one in Paris but her Divine Highness Madame
la<br>
 Banque, or the great Nucingen, or some miserable miser who is in
love<br>
 with gold as we other folks are with a woman, could produce such
a<br>
 miracle! The civil list, civil as it may be, would beg you to
call<br>
 again tomorrow. Every one invests his money, and turns it over
to the<br>
 best of his powers.</p>

<p>"You are quite mistaken, my angel, if you suppose that King
Louis-<br>
 Philippe rules us; he himself knows better than that. He knows
as well<br>
 as we do that supreme above the Charter reigns the holy,
venerated,<br>
 substantial, delightful, obliging, beautiful, noble,
ever-youthful,<br>
 and all-powerful five-franc piece! But money, my beauty, insists
on<br>
 interest, and is always engaged in seeking it! 'God of the Jews,
thou<br>
 art supreme!' says Racine. The perennial parable of the golden
calf,<br>
 you see!--In the days of Moses there was stock-jobbing in the
desert!</p>

<p>"We have reverted to Biblical traditions; the Golden Calf was
the<br>
 first State ledger," he went on. "You, my Adeline, have not
gone<br>
 beyond the Rue Plumet. The Egyptians had lent enormous sums to
the<br>
 Hebrews, and what they ran after was not God's people, but
their<br>
 capital."</p>

<p>He looked at the Baroness with an expression which said, "How
clever I<br>
 am!"</p>

<p>"You know nothing of the devotion of every city man to his
sacred<br>
 hoard!" he went on, after a pause. "Excuse me. Listen to me. Get
this<br>
 well into your head.--You want two hundred thousand francs? No
one can<br>
 produce the sum without selling some security. Now consider! To
have<br>
 two hundred thousand francs in hard cash it would be needful to
sell<br>
 about seven hundred thousand francs' worth of stock at three per
cent.<br>
 Well; and then you would only get the money on the third day.
That is<br>
 the quickest way. To persuade a man to part with a fortune--for
two<br>
 hundred thousand francs is the whole fortune of many a man--he
ought<br>
 at least to know where it is all going to, and for what
purpose--"</p>

<p>"It is going, my dear kind Crevel, to save the lives of two
men, one<br>
 of whom will die of grief and the other will kill himself! And
to save<br>
 me too from going mad! Am I not a little mad already?"</p>

<p>"Not so mad!" said he, taking Madame Hulot round the knees;
"old<br>
 Crevel has his price, since you thought of applying to him, my
angel."</p>

<p>"They submit to have a man's arms round their knees, it would
seem!"<br>
 thought the saintly woman, covering her face with her hands.</p>

<p>"Once you offered me a fortune!" said she, turning red.</p>

<p>"Ay, mother! but that was three years ago!" replied Crevel.
"Well, you<br>
 are handsomer now than ever I saw you!" he went on, taking
the<br>
 Baroness' arm and pressing it to his heart. "You have a good
memory,<br>
 my dear, by Jove!--And now you see how wrong you were to be
so<br>
 prudish, for those three hundred thousand francs that you
refused so<br>
 magnanimously are in another woman's pocket. I loved you then, I
love<br>
 you still; but just look back these three years.</p>

<p>"When I said to you, 'You shall be mine,' what object had I in
view? I<br>
 meant to be revenged on that rascal Hulot. But your husband,
my<br>
 beauty, found himself a mistress--a jewel of a woman, a pearl,
a<br>
 cunning hussy then aged three-and-twenty, for she is
six-and-twenty<br>
 now. It struck me as more amusing, more complete, more Louis
XV., more<br>
 Marechal de Richelieu, more first-class altogether, to filch
away that<br>
 charmer, who, in point of fact, never cared for Hulot, and who
for<br>
 these three years has been madly in love with your humble
servant."</p>

<p>As he spoke, Crevel, from whose hands the Baroness had
released her<br>
 own, had resumed his favorite attitude; both thumbs were stuck
into<br>
 his armholes, and he was patting his ribs with his fingers, like
two<br>
 flapping wings, fancying that he was thus making himself
very<br>
 attractive and charming. It was as much as to say, "And this is
the<br>
 man you would have nothing to say to!"</p>

<p>"There you are my dear; I had my revenge, and your husband
knows it. I<br>
 proved to him clearly that he was basketed--just where he was
before,<br>
 as we say. Madame Marneffe is my mistress, and when her
precious<br>
 Marneffe kicks the bucket, she will be my wife."</p>

<p>Madame Hulot stared at Crevel with a fixed and almost dazed
look.</p>

<p>"Hector knew it?" she said.</p>

<p>"And went back to her," replied Crevel. "And I allowed it,
because<br>
 Valerie wished to be the wife of a head-clerk; but she promised
me<br>
 that she would manage things so that our Baron should be so<br>
 effectually bowled over that he can never interfere any more.
And my<br>
 little duchess--for that woman is a born duchess, on my
soul!--kept<br>
 her word. She restores you your Hector, madame, virtuous in<br>
 perpetuity, as she says--she is so witty! He has had a good
lesson, I<br>
 can tell you! The Baron has had some hard knocks; he will help
no more<br>
 actresses or fine ladies; he is radically cured; cleaned out
like a<br>
 beer-glass.</p>

<p>"If you had listened to Crevel in the first instance, instead
of<br>
 scorning him and turning him out of the house, you might have
had four<br>
 hundred thousand francs, for my revenge has cost me all of
that.--But<br>
 I shall get my change back, I hope, when Marneffe dies--I
have<br>
 invested in a wife, you see; that is the secret of my
extravagance. I<br>
 have solved the problem of playing the lord on easy terms."</p>

<p>"Would you give your daughter such a mother-in-law? cried
Madame<br>
 Hulot.</p>

<p>"You do not know Valerie, madame," replied Crevel gravely,
striking<br>
 the attitude of his first manner. "She is a woman with good
blood in<br>
 her veins, a lady, and a woman who enjoys the highest
consideration.<br>
 Why, only yesterday the vicar of the parish was dining with her.
She<br>
 is pious, and we have presented a splendid monstrance to the
church.</p>

<p>"Oh! she is clever, she is witty, she is delightful, well
informed--<br>
 she has everything in her favor. For my part, my dear Adeline, I
owe<br>
 everything to that charming woman; she has opened my mind,
polished my<br>
 speech, as you may have noticed; she corrects my impetuosity,
and<br>
 gives me words and ideas. I never say anything now that I ought
not. I<br>
 have greatly improved; you must have noticed it. And then she
has<br>
 encouraged my ambition. I shall be a Deputy; and I shall make
no<br>
 blunders, for I shall consult my Egeria. Every great politician,
from<br>
 Numa to our present Prime Minister, has had his Sibyl of the
fountain.<br>
 A score of deputies visit Valerie; she is acquiring
considerable<br>
 influence; and now that she is about to be established in a
charming<br>
 house, with a carriage, she will be one of the occult rulers of
Paris.</p>

<p>"A fine locomotive! That is what such a woman is. Oh, I have
blessed<br>
 you many a time for your stern virtue."</p>

<p>"It is enough to make one doubt the goodness of God!" cried
Adeline,<br>
 whose indignation had dried her tears. "But, no! Divine justice
must<br>
 be hanging over her head."</p>

<p>"You know nothing of the world, my beauty," said the great
politician,<br>
 deeply offended. "The world, my Adeline, loves success! Say,
now, has<br>
 it come to seek out your sublime virtue, priced at two
hundred<br>
 thousand francs?"</p>

<p>The words made Madame Hulot shudder; the nervous trembling
attacked<br>
 her once more. She saw that the ex-perfumer was taking a mean
revenge<br>
 on her as he had on Hulot; she felt sick with disgust, and a
spasm<br>
 rose to her throat, hindering speech.</p>

<p>"Money!" she said at last. "Always money!"</p>

<p>"You touched me deeply," said Crevel, reminded by these words
of the<br>
 woman's humiliation, "when I beheld you there, weeping at my
feet!--<br>
 You perhaps will not believe me, but if I had my pocket-book
about me,<br>
 it would have been yours.--Come, do you really want such a
sum?"</p>

<p>As she heard this question, big with two hundred thousand
francs,<br>
 Adeline forgot the odious insults heaped on her by this
cheap-jack<br>
 fine gentleman, before the tempting picture of success described
by<br>
 Machiavelli-Crevel, who only wanted to find out her secrets and
laugh<br>
 over them with Valerie.</p>

<p>"Oh! I will do anything, everything," cried the unhappy
woman.<br>
 "Monsieur, I will sell myself--I will be a Valerie, if I
must."</p>

<p>"You will find that difficult," replied Crevel. "Valerie is
a<br>
 masterpiece in her way. My good mother, twenty-five years of
virtue<br>
 are always repellent, like a badly treated disease. And your
virtue<br>
 has grown very mouldy, my dear child. But you shall see how much
I<br>
 love you. I will manage to get you your two hundred thousand
francs."</p>

<p>Adeline, incapable of uttering a word, seized his hand and
laid it on<br>
 her heart; a tear of joy trembled in her eyes.</p>

<p>"Oh! don't be in a hurry; there will be some hard pulling. I
am a<br>
 jolly good fellow, a good soul with no prejudices, and I will
put<br>
 things plainly to you. You want to do as Valerie does--very
good. But<br>
 that is not all; you must have a gull, a stockholder, a
Hulot.--Well,<br>
 I know a retired tradesman--in fact, a hosier. He is heavy,
dull, has<br>
 not an idea, I am licking him into shape, but I don't know when
he<br>
 will do me credit. My man is a deputy, stupid and conceited;
the<br>
 tyranny of a turbaned wife, in the depths of the country,
has<br>
 preserved him in a state of utter virginity as to the luxury
and<br>
 pleasures of Paris life. But Beauvisage--his name is
Beauvisage--is a<br>
 millionaire, and, like me, my dear, three years ago, he will
give a<br>
 hundred thousand crowns to be the lover of a real lady.--Yes,
you<br>
 see," he went on, misunderstanding a gesture on Adeline's part,
"he is<br>
 jealous of me, you understand; jealous of my happiness with
Madame<br>
 Marneffe, and he is a fellow quite capable of selling an estate
to<br>
 purchase a--"</p>

<p><br>
 "Enough, Monsieur Crevel!" said Madame Hulot, no longer
controlling<br>
 her disgust, and showing all her shame in her face. "I am
punished<br>
 beyond my deserts. My conscience, so sternly repressed by the
iron<br>
 hand of necessity, tells me, at this final insult, that such<br>
 sacrifices are impossible.--My pride is gone; I do not say now,
as I<br>
 did the first time, 'Go!' after receiving this mortal thrust. I
have<br>
 lost the right to do so. I have flung myself before you like
a<br>
 prostitute.</p>

<p>"Yes," she went on, in reply to a negative on Crevel's part,
"I have<br>
 fouled my life, till now so pure, by a degrading thought; and I
am<br>
 inexcusable!--I know it!--I deserve every insult you can offer
me!<br>
 God's will be done! If, indeed, He desires the death of two
creatures<br>
 worthy to appear before Him, they must die! I shall mourn them,
and<br>
 pray for them! If it is His will that my family should be
humbled to<br>
 the dust, we must bow to His avenging sword, nay, and kiss it,
since<br>
 we are Christians.--I know how to expiate this disgrace, which
will be<br>
 the torment of all my remaining days.</p>

<p>"I who speak to you, monsieur, am not Madame Hulot, but a
wretched,<br>
 humble sinner, a Christian whose heart henceforth will know but
one<br>
 feeling, and that is repentance, all my time given up to prayer
and<br>
 charity. With such a sin on my soul, I am the last of women, the
first<br>
 only of penitents.--You have been the means of bringing me to a
right<br>
 mind; I can hear the Voice of God speaking within me, and I can
thank<br>
 you!"</p>

<p>She was shaking with the nervous trembling which from that
hour never<br>
 left her. Her low, sweet tones were quite unlike the fevered
accents<br>
 of the woman who was ready for dishonor to save her family. The
blood<br>
 faded from her cheeks, her face was colorless, and her eyes were
dry.</p>

<p>"And I played my part very badly, did I not?" she went on,
looking at<br>
 Crevel with the sweetness that martyrs must have shown in their
eyes<br>
 as they looked up at the Proconsul. "True love, the sacred love
of a<br>
 devoted woman, gives other pleasures, no doubt, than those that
are<br>
 bought in the open market!--But why so many words?" said she,
suddenly<br>
 bethinking herself, and advancing a step further in the way
to<br>
 perfection. "They sound like irony, but I am not ironical!
Forgive me.<br>
 Besides, monsieur, I did not want to hurt any one but
myself--"</p>

<p>The dignity of virtue and its holy flame had expelled the
transient<br>
 impurity of the woman who, splendid in her own peculiar beauty,
looked<br>
 taller in Crevel's eyes. Adeline had, at this moment, the
majesty of<br>
 the figures of Religion clinging to the Cross, as painted by the
old<br>
 Venetians; but she expressed, too, the immensity of her love and
the<br>
 grandeur of the Catholic Church, to which she flew like a
wounded<br>
 dove.</p>

<p>Crevel was dazzled, astounded.</p>

<p>"Madame, I am your slave, without conditions," said he, in
an<br>
 inspiration of generosity. "We will look into this
matter--and--<br>
 whatever you want--the impossible even--I will do. I will pledge
my<br>
 securities at the Bank, and in two hours you shall have the
money."</p>

<p>"Good God! a miracle!" said poor Adeline, falling on her
knees.</p>

<p>She prayed to Heaven with such fervor as touched Crevel
deeply; Madame<br>
 Hulot saw that he had tears in his eyes when, having ended her
prayer,<br>
 she rose to her feet.</p>

<p>"Be a friend to me, monsieur," said she. "Your heart is better
than<br>
 your words and conduct. God gave you your soul; your passions
and the<br>
 world have given you your ideas. Oh, I will love you truly,"
she<br>
 exclaimed, with an angelic tenderness in strange contrast with
her<br>
 attempts at coquettish trickery.</p>

<p>"But cease to tremble so," said Crevel.</p>

<p>"Am I trembling?" said the Baroness, unconscious of the
infirmity that<br>
 had so suddenly come upon her.</p>

<p>"Yes; why, look," said Crevel, taking Adeline by the arm and
showing<br>
 her that she was shaking with nervousness. "Come, madame," he
added<br>
 respectfully, "compose yourself; I am going to the Bank at
once."</p>

<p>"And come back quickly! Remember," she added, betraying all
her<br>
 secrets, "that the first point is to prevent the suicide of our
poor<br>
 Uncle Fischer involved by my husband--for I trust you now, and I
am<br>
 telling you everything. Oh, if we should not be on time, I know
my<br>
 brother-in-law, the Marshal, and he has such a delicate soul,
that he<br>
 would die of it in a few days."</p>

<p>"I am off, then," said Crevel, kissing the Baroness' hand.
"But what<br>
 has that unhappy Hulot done?"</p>

<p>"He has swindled the Government."</p>

<p>"Good Heavens! I fly, madame; I understand, I admire you!"</p>

<p>Crevel bent one knee, kissed Madame Hulot's skirt, and
vanished,<br>
 saying, "You will see me soon."</p>

<p>Unluckily, on his way from the Rue Plumet to his own house, to
fetch<br>
 the securities, Crevel went along the Rue Vanneau, and he could
not<br>
 resist going in to see his little Duchess. His face still bore
an<br>
 agitated expression.</p>

<p>He went straight into Valerie's room, who was having her hair
dressed.<br>
 She looked at Crevel in her glass, and, like every woman of that
sort,<br>
 was annoyed, before she knew anything about it, to see that he
was<br>
 moved by some strong feeling of which she was not the cause.</p>

<p>"What is the matter, my dear?" said she. "Is that a face to
bring in<br>
 to your little Duchess? I will not be your Duchess any more,
monsieur,<br>
 no more than I will be your 'little duck,' you old monster."</p>

<p>Crevel replied by a melancholy smile and a glance at the
maid.</p>

<p>"Reine, child, that will do for to-day; I can finish my hair
myself.<br>
 Give me my Chinese wrapper; my gentleman seems to me out of
sorts."</p>

<p>Reine, whose face was pitted like a colander, and who seemed
to have<br>
 been made on purpose to wait on Valerie, smiled meaningly in
reply,<br>
 and brought the dressing-gown. Valerie took off her
combing-wrapper;<br>
 she was in her shift, and she wriggled into the dressing-gown
like a<br>
 snake into a clump of grass.</p>

<p>"Madame is not at home?"</p>

<p>"What a question!" said Valerie.--"Come, tell me, my big puss,
have<br>
 <i>Rives Gauches</i> gone down?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"They have raised the price of the house?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"You fancy that you are not the father of our little
Crevel?"</p>

<p>"What nonsense!" replied he, sure of his paternity.</p>

<p>"On my honor, I give it up!" said Madame Marneffe. "If I am
expected<br>
 to extract my friend's woes as you pull the cork out of a bottle
of<br>
 Bordeaux, I let it alone.--Go away, you bore me."</p>

<p>"It is nothing," said Crevel. "I must find two hundred
thousand francs<br>
 in two hours."</p>

<p>"Oh, you can easily get them.--I have not spent the fifty
thousand<br>
 francs we got out of Hulot for that report, and I can ask Henri
for<br>
 fifty thousand--"</p>

<p>"Henri--it is always Henri!" exclaimed Crevel.</p>

<p>"And do you suppose, you great baby of a Machiavelli, that I
will cast<br>
 off Henri? Would France disarm her fleet?--Henri! why, he is a
dagger<br>
 in a sheath hanging on a nail. That boy serves as a
weather-glass to<br>
 show me if you love me--and you don't love me this morning."</p>

<p>"I don't love you, Valerie?" cried Crevel. "I love you as much
as a<br>
 million."</p>

<p>"That is not nearly enough!" cried she, jumping on to Crevel's
knee,<br>
 and throwing both arms round his neck as if it were a peg to
hang on<br>
 by. "I want to be loved as much as ten millions, as much as all
the<br>
 gold in the world, and more to that. Henri would never wait a
minute<br>
 before telling me all he had on his mind. What is it, my great
pet?<br>
 Have it out. Make a clean breast of it to your own little
duck!"</p>

<p>And she swept her hair over Crevel's face, while she jestingly
pulled<br>
 his nose.</p>

<p>"Can a man with a nose like that," she went on, "have any
secrets from<br>
 his <i>Vava--lele--ririe</i>?"</p>

<p>And at the <i>Vava</i> she tweaked his nose to the right; at
<i>lele</i> it went<br>
 to the left; at <i>ririe</i> she nipped it straight again.</p>

<p>"Well, I have just seen--" Crevel stopped and looked at
Madame<br>
 Marneffe.</p>

<p>"Valerie, my treasure, promise me on your honor--ours, you
know?--not<br>
 to repeat a single word of what I tell you."</p>

<p>"Of course, Mayor, we know all about that. One hand
up--so--and one<br>
 foot--so!" And she put herself in an attitude which, to use
Rabelais'<br>
 phrase, stripped Crevel bare from his brain to his heels, so
quaint<br>
 and delicious was the nudity revealed through the light film of
lawn.</p>

<p>"I have just seen virtue in despair."</p>

<p>"Can despair possess virtue?" said she, nodding gravely and
crossing<br>
 her arms like Napoleon.</p>

<p>"It is poor Madame Hulot. She wants two hundred thousand
francs, or<br>
 else Marshal Hulot and old Johann Fischer will blow their brains
out;<br>
 and as you, my little Duchess, are partly at the bottom of
the<br>
 mischief, I am going to patch matters up. She is a saintly
creature, I<br>
 know her well; she will repay you every penny."</p>

<p>At the name of Hulot, at the words two hundred thousand
francs, a<br>
 gleam from Valerie's eyes flashed from between her long eyelids
like<br>
 the flame of a cannon through the smoke.</p>

<p>"What did the old thing do to move you to compassion? Did she
show you<br>
 --what?--her--her religion?"</p>

<p>"Do not make game of her, sweetheart; she is a very saintly, a
very<br>
 noble and pious woman, worthy of all respect."</p>

<p>"Am I not worthy of respect then, heh?" answered Valerie, with
a<br>
 threatening gaze at Crevel.</p>

<p>"I never said so," replied he, understanding that the praise
of virtue<br>
 might not be gratifying to Madame Marneffe.</p>

<p>"I am pious too," Valerie went on, taking her seat in an
armchair;<br>
 "but I do not make a trade of my religion. I go to church in
secret."</p>

<p>She sat in silence, and paid no further heed to Crevel. He,
extremely<br>
 ill at ease, came to stand in front of the chair into which
Valerie<br>
 had thrown herself, and saw her lost in the reflections he had
been so<br>
 foolish as to suggest.</p>

<p>"Valerie, my little Angel!"</p>

<p>Utter silence. A highly problematical tear was furtively
dashed away.</p>

<p>"One word, my little duck?"</p>

<p>"Monsieur!"</p>

<p>"What are you thinking of, my darling?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Monsieur Crevel, I was thinking of the day of my first
communion!<br>
 How pretty I was! How pure, how saintly!--immaculate!--Oh! if
any one<br>
 had come to my mother and said, 'Your daughter will be a hussy,
and<br>
 unfaithful to her husband; one day a police-officer will find
her in a<br>
 disreputable house; she will sell herself to a Crevel to cheat a
Hulot<br>
 --two horrible old men--' Poof! horrible--she would have died
before<br>
 the end of the sentence, she was so fond of me, poor
dear!--"</p>

<p>"Nay, be calm."</p>

<p>"You cannot think how well a woman must love a man before she
can<br>
 silence the remorse that gnaws at the heart of an adulterous
wife. I<br>
 am quite sorry that Reine is not here; she would have told you
that<br>
 she found me this morning praying with tears in my eyes. I,
Monsieur<br>
 Crevel, for my part, do not make a mockery of religion. Have you
ever<br>
 heard me say a word I ought not on such a subject?"</p>

<p>Crevel shook his head in negation.</p>

<p>"I will never allow it to be mentioned in my presence. I can
make fun<br>
 of anything under the sun: Kings, politics, finance, everything
that<br>
 is sacred in the eyes of the world--judges, matrimony, and
love--old<br>
 men and maidens. But the Church and God!--There I draw the
line.--I<br>
 know I am wicked; I am sacrificing my future life to you. And
you have<br>
 no conception of the immensity of my love."</p>

<p>Crevel clasped his hands.</p>

<p>"No, unless you could see into my heart, and fathom the depth
of my<br>
 conviction so as to know the extent of my sacrifice! I feel in
me the<br>
 making of a Magdalen.--And see how respectfully I treat the
priests;<br>
 think of the gifts I make to the Church! My mother brought me up
in<br>
 the Catholic Faith, and I know what is meant by God! It is to
sinners<br>
 like us that His voice is most awful."</p>

<p>Valerie wiped away two tears that trickled down her cheeks.
Crevel was<br>
 in dismay. Madame Marneffe stood up in her excitement.</p>

<p>"Be calm, my darling--you alarm me!"</p>

<p>Madame Marneffe fell on her knees.</p>

<p>"Dear Heaven! I am not bad all through!" she cried, clasping
her<br>
 hands. "Vouchsafe to rescue Thy wandering lamb, strike her,
crush her,<br>
 snatch her from foul and adulterous hands, and how gladly she
will<br>
 nestle on Thy shoulder! How willingly she will return to the
fold!"</p>

<p>She got up and looked at Crevel; her colorless eyes frightened
him.</p>

<p>"Yes, Crevel, and, do you know? I, too, am frightened
sometimes. The<br>
 justice of God is exerted in this nether world as well as in the
next.<br>
 What mercy can I expect at God's hands? His vengeance overtakes
the<br>
 guilty in many ways; it assumes every aspect of disaster. That
is what<br>
 my mother told me on her death-bed, speaking of her own old
age.--But<br>
 if I should lose you, she added, hugging Crevel with a sort of
savage<br>
 frenzy--"oh! I should die!"</p>

<p>Madame Marneffe released Crevel, knelt down again at the
armchair,<br>
 folded her hands--and in what a bewitching attitude!--and
with<br>
 incredible fervor poured out the following prayer:--</p>

<p>"And thou, Saint Valerie, my patron saint, why dost thou so
rarely<br>
 visit the pillow of her who was intrusted to thy care? Oh, come
this<br>
 evening, as thou didst this morning, to inspire me with holy
thoughts,<br>
 and I will quit the path of sin; like the Magdalen, I will give
up<br>
 deluding joys and the false glitter of the world, even the man I
love<br>
 so well--"</p>

<p>"My precious duck!"</p>

<p>"No more of the 'precious duck,' monsieur!" said she, turning
round<br>
 like a virtuous wife, her eyes full of tears, but dignified,
cold, and<br>
 indifferent.</p>

<p>"Leave me," she went on, pushing him from her. "What is my
duty? To<br>
 belong wholly to my husband.--He is a dying man, and what am I
doing?<br>
 Deceiving him on the edge of the grave. He believes your child
to be<br>
 his. I will tell him the truth, and begin by securing his
pardon<br>
 before I ask for God's.--We must part. Good-bye, Monsieur
Crevel," and<br>
 she stood up to offer him an icy cold hand. "Good-bye, my
friend; we<br>
 shall meet no more till we meet in a better world.--You have to
thank<br>
 me for some enjoyment, criminal indeed; now I want--oh yes, I
shall<br>
 have your esteem."</p>

<p><br>
 Crevel was weeping bitter tears.</p>

<p>"You great pumpkin!" she exclaimed, with an infernal peal of
laughter.<br>
 "That is how your pious women go about it to drag from you a
plum of<br>
 two hundred thousand francs. And you, who talk of the Marechal
de<br>
 Richelieu, the prototype of Lovelace, you could be taken in by
such a<br>
 stale trick as that! I could get hundreds of thousands of francs
out<br>
 of you any day, if I chose, you old ninny!--Keep your money! If
you<br>
 have more than you know what to do with, it is mine. If you give
two<br>
 sous to that 'respectable' woman, who is pious forsooth, because
she<br>
 is fifty-six years of age, we shall never meet again, and you
may take<br>
 her for your mistress! You could come back to me next day
bruised all<br>
 over from her bony caresses and sodden with her tears, and sick
of her<br>
 little barmaid's caps and her whimpering, which must turn her
favors<br>
 into showers--"</p>

<p>"In point of fact," said Crevel, "two hundred thousand francs
is a<br>
 round sum of money."</p>

<p>"They have fine appetites, have the goody sort! By the poker!
they<br>
 sell their sermons dearer than we sell the rarest and realest
thing on<br>
 earth--pleasure.--And they can spin a yarn! There, I know them.
I have<br>
 seen plenty in my mother's house. They think everything is
allowable<br>
 for the Church and for--Really, my dear love, you ought to be
ashamed<br>
 of yourself--for you are not so open-handed! You have not given
me two<br>
 hundred thousand francs all told!"</p>

<p>"Oh yes," said Crevel, "your little house will cost as much as
that."</p>

<p>"Then you have four hundred thousand francs?" said she
thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Then, sir, you meant to lend that old horror the two hundred
thousand<br>
 francs due for my hotel? What a crime, what high treason!"</p>

<p>"Only listen to me."</p>

<p>"If you were giving the money to some idiotic philanthropic
scheme,<br>
 you would be regarded as a coming man," she went on, with
increasing<br>
 eagerness, "and I should be the first to advise it; for you are
too<br>
 simple to write a big political book that might make you famous;
as<br>
 for style, you have not enough to butter a pamphlet; but you
might do<br>
 as other men do who are in your predicament, and who get a halo
of<br>
 glory about their name by putting it at the top of some social,
or<br>
 moral, or general, or national enterprise. Benevolence is out of
date,<br>
 quite vulgar. Providing for old offenders, and making them
more<br>
 comfortable than the poor devils who are honest, is played out.
What I<br>
 should like to see is some invention of your own with an
endowment of<br>
 two hundred thousand francs--something difficult and really
useful.<br>
 Then you would be talked about as a man of mark, a Montyon, and
I<br>
 should be very proud of you!</p>

<p>"But as to throwing two hundred thousand francs into a
holy-water<br>
 shell, or lending them to a bigot--cast off by her husband, and
who<br>
 knows why? there is always some reason: does any one cast me
off, I<br>
 ask you?--is a piece of idiocy which in our days could only come
into<br>
 the head of a retired perfumer. It reeks of the counter. You
would not<br>
 dare look at yourself in the glass two days after.</p>

<p>"Go and pay the money in where it will be safe--run, fly; I
will not<br>
 admit you again without the receipt in your hand. Go, as fast
and soon<br>
 as you can!"</p>

<p>She pushed Crevel out of the room by the shoulders, seeing
avarice<br>
 blossoming in his face once more. When she heard the outer door
shut,<br>
 she exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Then Lisbeth is revenged over and over again! What a pity
that she is<br>
 at her old Marshal's now! We would have had a good laugh! So
that old<br>
 woman wants to take the bread out of my mouth. I will startle
her a<br>
 little!"</p>

<p>Marshal Hulot, being obliged to live in a style suited to the
highest<br>
 military rank, had taken a handsome house in the Rue du
Mont-Parnasse,<br>
 where there are three or four princely residences. Though he
rented<br>
 the whole house, he inhabited only the ground floor. When
Lisbeth went<br>
 to keep house for him, she at once wished to let the first
floor,<br>
 which, as she said, would pay the whole rent, so that the Count
would<br>
 live almost rent-free; but the old soldier would not hear of
it.</p>

<p>For some months past the Marshal had had many sad thoughts. He
had<br>
 guessed how miserably poor his sister-in-law was, and suspected
her<br>
 griefs without understanding their cause. The old man, so
cheerful in<br>
 his deafness, became taciturn; he could not help thinking that
his<br>
 house would one day be a refuge for the Baroness and her
daughter; and<br>
 it was for them that he kept the first floor. The smallness of
his<br>
 fortune was so well known at headquarters, that the War
Minister, the<br>
 Prince de Wissembourg, begged his old comrade to accept a sum of
money<br>
 for his household expenses. This sum the Marshal spent in
furnishing<br>
 the ground floor, which was in every way suitable; for, as he
said, he<br>
 would not accept the Marshal's baton to walk the streets
with.</p>

<p>The house had belonged to a senator under the Empire, and the
ground<br>
 floor drawing-rooms had been very magnificently fitted with
carved<br>
 wood, white-and-gold, still in very good preservation. The
Marshal had<br>
 found some good old furniture in the same style; in the
coach-house he<br>
 had a carriage with two batons in saltire on the panels; and
when he<br>
 was expected to appear in full fig, at the Minister's, at
the<br>
 Tuileries, for some ceremony or high festival, he hired horses
for the<br>
 job.</p>

<p>His servant for more than thirty years was an old soldier of
sixty,<br>
 whose sister was the cook, so he had saved ten thousand francs,
adding<br>
 it by degrees to a little hoard he intended for Hortense. Every
day<br>
 the old man walked along the boulevard, from the Rue du
Mont-Parnasse<br>
 to the Rue Plumet; and every pensioner as he passed stood at<br>
 attention, without fail, to salute him: then the Marshal
rewarded the<br>
 veteran with a smile.</p>

<p>"Who is the man you always stand at attention to salute?" said
a young<br>
 workman one day to an old captain and pensioner.</p>

<p>"I will tell you, boy," replied the officer.</p>

<p>The "boy" stood resigned, as a man does to listen to an old
gossip.</p>

<p>"In 1809," said the captain, "we were covering the flank of
the main<br>
 army, marching on Vienna under the Emperor's command. We came to
a<br>
 bridge defended by three batteries of cannon, one above another,
on a<br>
 sort of cliff; three redoubts like three shelves, and commanding
the<br>
 bridge. We were under Marshal Massena. That man whom you see
there was<br>
 Colonel of the Grenadier Guards, and I was one of them. Our
columns<br>
 held one bank of the river, the batteries were on the other.
Three<br>
 times they tried for the bridge, and three times they were
driven<br>
 back. 'Go and find Hulot!' said the Marshal; 'nobody but he and
his<br>
 men can bolt that morsel.' So we came. The General, who was
just<br>
 retiring from the bridge, stopped Hulot under fire, to tell him
how to<br>
 do it, and he was in the way. 'I don't want advice, but room to
pass,'<br>
 said our General coolly, marching across at the head of his men.
And<br>
 then, rattle, thirty guns raking us at once."</p>

<p>"By Heaven!" cried the workman, "that accounts for some of
these<br>
 crutches!"</p>

<p>"And if you, like me, my boy, had heard those words so quietly
spoken,<br>
 you would bow before that man down to the ground! It is not so
famous<br>
 as Arcole, but perhaps it was finer. We followed Hulot at the
double,<br>
 right up to those batteries. All honor to those we left there!"
and<br>
 the old man lifted his hat. "The Austrians were amazed at the
dash of<br>
 it.--The Emperor made the man you saw a Count; he honored us all
by<br>
 honoring our leader; and the King of to-day was very right to
make him<br>
 a Marshal."</p>

<p>"Hurrah for the Marshal!" cried the workman.</p>

<p>"Oh, you may shout--shout away! The Marshal is as deaf as a
post from<br>
 the roar of cannon."</p>

<p>This anecdote may give some idea of the respect with which
the<br>
 <i>Invalides</i> regarded Marshal Hulot, whose Republican
proclivities<br>
 secured him the popular sympathy of the whole quarter of the
town.</p>

<p>Sorrow taking hold on a spirit so calm and strict and noble,
was a<br>
 heart-breaking spectacle. The Baroness could only tell lies,
with a<br>
 woman's ingenuity, to conceal the whole dreadful truth from
her<br>
 brother-in-law.</p>

<p>In the course of this miserable morning, the Marshal, who,
like all<br>
 old men, slept but little, had extracted from Lisbeth full
particulars<br>
 as to his brother's situation, promising to marry her as the
reward of<br>
 her revelations. Any one can imagine with what glee the old
maid<br>
 allowed the secrets to be dragged from her which she had been
dying to<br>
 tell ever since she had come into the house; for by this means
she<br>
 made her marriage more certain.</p>

<p>"Your brother is incorrigible!" Lisbeth shouted into the
Marshal's<br>
 best ear.</p>

<p>Her strong, clear tones enabled her to talk to him, but she
wore out<br>
 her lungs, so anxious was she to prove to her future husband
that to<br>
 her he would never be deaf.</p>

<p>"He has had three mistresses," said the old man, "and his wife
was an<br>
 Adeline! Poor Adeline!"</p>

<p>"If you will take my advice," shrieked Lisbeth, "you will use
your<br>
 influence with the Prince de Wissembourg to secure her some
suitable<br>
 appointment. She will need it, for the Baron's pay is pledged
for<br>
 three years."</p>

<p>"I will go to the War Office," said he, "and see the Prince,
to find<br>
 out what he thinks of my brother, and ask for his interest to
help my<br>
 sister. Think of some place that is fit for her."</p>

<p>"The charitable ladies of Paris, in concert with the
Archbishop, have<br>
 formed various beneficent associations; they employ
superintendents,<br>
 very decently paid, whose business it is to seek out cases of
real<br>
 want. Such an occupation would exactly suit dear Adeline; it
would be<br>
 work after her own heart."</p>

<p>"Send to order the horses," said the Marshal. "I will go and
dress. I<br>
 will drive to Neuilly if necessary."</p>

<p>"How fond he is of her! She will always cross my path wherever
I<br>
 turn!" said Lisbeth to herself.</p>

<p>Lisbeth was already supreme in the house, but not with the
Marshal's<br>
 cognizance. She had struck terror into the three servants--for
she had<br>
 allowed herself a housemaid, and she exerted her old-maidish
energy in<br>
 taking stock of everything, examining everything, and arranging
in<br>
 every respect for the comfort of her dear Marshal. Lisbeth,
quite as<br>
 Republican as he could be, pleased him by her democratic
opinions, and<br>
 she flattered him with amazing dexterity; for the last fortnight
the<br>
 old man, whose house was better kept, and who was cared for as a
child<br>
 by its mother, had begun to regard Lisbeth as a part of what he
had<br>
 dreamed of.</p>

<p>"My dear Marshal," she shouted, following him out on to the
steps,<br>
 "pull up the windows, do not sit in a draught, to oblige
me!"</p>

<p>The Marshal, who had never been so cosseted in his life, went
off<br>
 smiling at Lisbeth, though his heart was aching.</p>

<p>At the same hour Baron Hulot was quitting the War Office to
call on<br>
 his chief, Marshal the Prince de Wissembourg, who had sent for
him.<br>
 Though there was nothing extraordinary in one of the Generals on
the<br>
 Board being sent for, Hulot's conscience was so uneasy that he
fancied<br>
 he saw a cold and sinister expression in Mitouflet's face.</p>

<p>"Mitouflet, how is the Prince?" he asked, locking the door of
his<br>
 private room and following the messenger who led the way.</p>

<p>"He must have a crow to pluck with you, Monsieur le Baron,"
replied<br>
 the man, "for his face is set at stormy."</p>

<p>Hulot turned pale, and said no more; he crossed the anteroom
and<br>
 reception rooms, and, with a violently beating heart, found
himself at<br>
 the door of the Prince's private study.</p>

<p>The chief, at this time seventy years old, with perfectly
white hair,<br>
 and the tanned complexion of a soldier of that age,
commanded<br>
 attention by a brow so vast that imagination saw in it a field
of<br>
 battle. Under this dome, crowned with snow, sparkled a pair of
eyes,<br>
 of the Napoleon blue, usually sad-looking and full of bitter
thoughts<br>
 and regrets, their fire overshadowed by the penthouse of the
strongly<br>
 projecting brow. This man, Bernadotte's rival, had hoped to find
his<br>
 seat on a throne. But those eyes could flash formidable
lightnings<br>
 when they expressed strong feelings.</p>

<p>Then, his voice, always somewhat hollow, rang with strident
tones.<br>
 When he was angry, the Prince was a soldier once more; he spoke
the<br>
 language of Lieutenant Cottin; he spared nothing--nobody. Hulot
d'Ervy<br>
 found the old lion, his hair shaggy like a mane, standing by
the<br>
 fireplace, his brows knit, his back against the mantel-shelf,
and his<br>
 eyes apparently fixed on vacancy.</p>

<p>"Here! At your orders, Prince!" said Hulot, affecting a
graceful ease<br>
 of manner.</p>

<p>The Marshal looked hard at the Baron, without saying a word,
during<br>
 the time it took him to come from the door to within a few steps
of<br>
 where the chief stood. This leaden stare was like the eye of
God;<br>
 Hulot could not meet it; he looked down in confusion.</p>

<p>"He knows everything!" said he to himself.</p>

<p>"Does your conscience tell you nothing?" asked the Marshal, in
his<br>
 deep, hollow tones.</p>

<p>"It tells me, sir, that I have been wrong, no doubt, in
ordering<br>
 <i>razzias</i> in Algeria without referring the matter to you.
At my age,<br>
 and with my tastes, after forty-five years of service, I have
no<br>
 fortune.--You know the principles of the four hundred elect<br>
 representatives of France. Those gentlemen are envious of
every<br>
 distinction; they have pared down even the Ministers' pay--that
says<br>
 everything! Ask them for money for an old servant!--What can
you<br>
 expect of men who pay a whole class so badly as they pay the<br>
 Government legal officials?--who give thirty sous a day to
the<br>
 laborers on the works at Toulon, when it is a physical
impossibility<br>
 to live there and keep a family on less than forty sous?--who
never<br>
 think of the atrocity of giving salaries of six hundred francs,
up to<br>
 a thousand or twelve hundred perhaps, to clerks living in Paris;
and<br>
 who want to secure our places for themselves as soon as the pay
rises<br>
 to forty thousand?--who, finally, refuse to restore to the Crown
a<br>
 piece of Crown property confiscated from the Crown in
1830--property<br>
 acquired, too, by Louis XVI. out of his privy purse!--If you had
no<br>
 private fortune, Prince, you would be left high and dry, like
my<br>
 brother, with your pay and not another sou, and no thought of
your<br>
 having saved the army, and me with it, in the boggy plains of
Poland."</p>

<p>"You have robbed the State! You have made yourself liable to
be<br>
 brought before the bench at Assizes," said the Marshal, "like
that<br>
 clerk of the Treasury! And you take this, monsieur, with such
levity."</p>

<p>"But there is a great difference, monseigneur!" cried the
baron. "Have<br>
 I dipped my hands into a cash box intrusted to my care?"</p>

<p>"When a man of your rank commits such an infamous crime," said
the<br>
 Marshal, "he is doubly guilty if he does it clumsily. You
have<br>
 compromised the honor of our official administration, which
hitherto<br>
 has been the purest in Europe!--And all for two hundred
thousand<br>
 francs and a hussy!" said the Marshal, in a terrible voice. "You
are a<br>
 Councillor of State--and a private soldier who sells
anything<br>
 belonging to his regiment is punished with death! Here is a
story told<br>
 to me one day by Colonel Pourin of the Second Lancers. At
Saverne, one<br>
 of his men fell in love with a little Alsatian girl who had a
fancy<br>
 for a shawl. The jade teased this poor devil of a lancer so<br>
 effectually, that though he could show twenty years' service,
and was<br>
 about to be promoted to be quartermaster--the pride of the
regiment--<br>
 to buy this shawl he sold some of his company's kit.--Do you
know what<br>
 this lancer did, Baron d'Ervy? He swallowed some window-glass
after<br>
 pounding it down, and died in eleven hours, of an illness,
in<br>
 hospital.--Try, if you please, to die of apoplexy, that we may
not see<br>
 you dishonored."</p>

<p>Hulot looked with haggard eyes at the old warrior; and the
Prince,<br>
 reading the look which betrayed the coward, felt a flush rise to
his<br>
 cheeks; his eyes flamed.</p>

<p>"Will you, sir, abandon me?" Hulot stammered.</p>

<p>Marshal Hulot, hearing that only his brother was with the
Minister,<br>
 ventured at this juncture to come in, and, like all deaf people,
went<br>
 straight up to the Prince.</p>

<p>"Oh," cried the hero of Poland, "I know what you are here for,
my old<br>
 friend! But we can do nothing."</p>

<p>"Do nothing!" echoed Marshal Hulot, who had heard only the
last word.</p>

<p>"Nothing; you have come to intercede for your brother. But do
you know<br>
 what your brother is?"</p>

<p>"My brother?" asked the deaf man.</p>

<p>"Yes, he is a damned infernal blackguard, and unworthy of
you."</p>

<p>The Marshal in his rage shot from his eyes those fulminating
fires<br>
 which, like Napoleon's, broke a man's will and judgment.</p>

<p>"You lie, Cottin!" said Marshal Hulot, turning white. "Throw
down your<br>
 baton as I throw mine! I am ready."</p>

<p>The Prince went up to his old comrade, looked him in the face,
and<br>
 shouted in his ear as he grasped his hand:</p>

<p>"Are you a man?"</p>

<p>"You will see that I am."</p>

<p>"Well, then, pull yourself together! You must face the
worst<br>
 misfortune that can befall you."</p>

<p>The Prince turned round, took some papers from the table, and
placed<br>
 them in the Marshal's hands, saying, "Read that."</p>

<p>The Comte de Forzheim read the following letter, which lay<br>
 uppermost:--</p>

<p>"To his Excellency the President of the Council.</p>

<p><i>"Private and Confidential.</i></p>

<p>"ALGIERS.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"MY DEAR PRINCE,--We have a very ugly business on our hands,
as<br>
 you will see by the accompanying documents.</p>

<p>"The story, briefly told, is this: Baron Hulot d'Ervy sent out
to<br>
 the province of Oran an uncle of his as a broker in grain
and<br>
 forage, and gave him an accomplice in the person of a
storekeeper.<br>
 This storekeeper, to curry favor, has made a confession, and<br>
 finally made his escape. The Public Prosecutor took the matter
up<br>
 very thoroughly, seeing, as he supposed, that only two
inferior<br>
 agents were implicated; but Johann Fischer, uncle to your Chief
of<br>
 the Commissariat Department, finding that he was to be brought
up<br>
 at the Assizes, stabbed himself in prison with a nail.</p>

<p>"That would have been the end of the matter if this worthy
and<br>
 honest man, deceived, it would seem, by his agent and by his<br>
 nephew, had not thought proper to write to Baron Hulot. This<br>
 letter, seized as a document, so greatly surprised the
Public<br>
 Prosecutor, that he came to see me. Now, the arrest and
public<br>
 trial of a Councillor of State would be such a terrible
thing--of<br>
 a man high in office too, who has a good record for loyal
service<br>
 --for after the Beresina, it was he who saved us all by<br>
 reorganizing the administration--that I desired to have all
the<br>
 papers sent to me.</p>

<p>"Is the matter to take its course? Now that the principal
agent is<br>
 dead, will it not be better to smother up the affair and
sentence<br>
 the storekeeper in default?</p>

<p>"The Public Prosecutor has consented to my forwarding the<br>
 documents for your perusal; the Baron Hulot d'Ervy, being
resident<br>
 in Paris, the proceedings will lie with your Supreme Court.
We<br>
 have hit on this rather shabby way of ridding ourselves of
the<br>
 difficulty for the moment.</p>

<p>"Only, my dear Marshal, decide quickly. This miserable
business is<br>
 too much talked about already, and it will do as much harm to
us<br>
 as to you all if the name of the principal culprit--known at<br>
 present only to the Public Prosecutor, the examining judge,
and<br>
 myself--should happen to leak out."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>At this point the letter fell from Marshal Hulot's hands; he
looked at<br>
 his brother; he saw that there was no need to examine the
evidence.<br>
 But he looked for Johann Fischer's letter, and after reading it
at a<br>
 glance, held it out to Hector:--</p>

<p><br>
 "FROM THE PRISON AT ORAN.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"DEAR NEPHEW,--When you read this letter, I shall have ceased
to<br>
 live.</p>

<p>"Be quite easy, no proof can be found to incriminate you. When
I<br>
 am dead and your Jesuit of a Chardin fled, the trial must<br>
 collapse. The face of our Adeline, made so happy by you,
makes<br>
 death easy to me. Now you need not send the two hundred
thousand<br>
 francs. Good-bye.</p>

<p>"This letter will be delivered by a prisoner for a short term
whom<br>
 I can trust, I believe.</p>

<p>"JOHANN FISCHER."</p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
 "I beg your pardon," said Marshal Hulot to the Prince de
Wissembourg<br>
 with pathetic pride.</p>

<p>"Come, come, say <i>tu</i>, not the formal <i>vous</i>,"
replied the Minister,<br>
 clasping his old friend's hand. "The poor lancer killed no one
but<br>
 himself," he added, with a thunderous look at Hulot d'Ervy.</p>

<p><br>
 "How much have you had?" said the Comte de Forzheim to his
brother.</p>

<p>"Two hundred thousand francs."</p>

<p>"My dear friend," said the Count, addressing the Minister,
"you shall<br>
 have the two hundred thousand francs within forty-eight hours.
It<br>
 shall never be said that a man bearing the name of Hulot has
wronged<br>
 the public treasury of a single sou."</p>

<p>"What nonsense!" said the Prince. "I know where the money is,
and I<br>
 can get it back.--Send in your resignation and ask for your
pension!"<br>
 he went on, sending a double sheet of foolscap flying across to
where<br>
 the Councillor of State had sat down by the table, for his legs
gave<br>
 way under him. "To bring you to trial would disgrace us all. I
have<br>
 already obtained from the superior Board their sanction to this
line<br>
 of action. Since you can accept life with dishonor--in my
opinion the<br>
 last degradation--you will get the pension you have earned. Only
take<br>
 care to be forgotten."</p>

<p>The Minister rang.</p>

<p>"Is Marneffe, the head-clerk, out there?"</p>

<p>"Yes, monseigneur."</p>

<p>"Show him in!"</p>

<p>"You," said the Minister as Marneffe came in, "you and your
wife have<br>
 wittingly and intentionally ruined the Baron d'Ervy whom you
see."</p>

<p>"Monsieur le Ministre, I beg your pardon. We are very poor. I
have<br>
 nothing to live on but my pay, and I have two children, and the
one<br>
 that is coming will have been brought into the family by
Monsieur le<br>
 Baron."</p>

<p>"What a villain he looks!" said the Prince, pointing to
Marneffe and<br>
 addressing Marshal Hulot.--"No more of Sganarelle speeches," he
went<br>
 on; "you will disgorge two hundred thousand francs, or be packed
off<br>
 to Algiers."</p>

<p>"But, Monsieur le Ministre, you do not know my wife. She has
spent it<br>
 all. Monsieur le Baron asked six persons to dinner every
evening.--<br>
 Fifty thousand francs a year are spent in my house."</p>

<p>"Leave the room!" said the Minister, in the formidable tones
that had<br>
 given the word to charge in battle. "You will have notice of
your<br>
 transfer within two hours. Go!"</p>

<p>"I prefer to send in my resignation," said Marneffe
insolently. "For<br>
 it is too much to be what I am already, and thrashed into the
bargain.<br>
 That would not satisfy me at all."</p>

<p>And he left the room.</p>

<p>"What an impudent scoundrel!" said the Prince.</p>

<p>Marshal Hulot, who had stood up throughout this scene, as pale
as a<br>
 corpse, studying his brother out of the corner of his eye, went
up to<br>
 the Prince, and took his hand, repeating:</p>

<p>"In forty-eight hours the pecuniary mischief shall be
repaired; but<br>
 honor!--Good-bye, Marshal. It is the last shot that kills. Yes,
I<br>
 shall die of it!" he said in his ear.</p>

<p>"What the devil brought you here this morning?" said the
Prince, much<br>
 moved.</p>

<p>"I came to see what can be done for his wife," replied the
Count,<br>
 pointing to his brother. "She is wanting bread--especially
now!"</p>

<p>"He has his pension."</p>

<p>"It is pledged!"</p>

<p>"The Devil must possess such a man," said the Prince, with a
shrug.<br>
 "What philtre do those baggages give you to rob you of your
wits?" he<br>
 went on to Hulot d'Ervy. "How could you--you, who know the
precise<br>
 details with which in French offices everything is written down
at<br>
 full length, consuming reams of paper to certify to the receipt
or<br>
 outlay of a few centimes--you, who have so often complained that
a<br>
 hundred signatures are needed for a mere trifle, to discharge
a<br>
 soldier, to buy a curry-comb--how could you hope to conceal a
theft<br>
 for any length of time? To say nothing of the newspapers, and
the<br>
 envious, and the people who would like to steal!--those women
must rob<br>
 you of your common-sense! Do they cover your eyes with
walnut-shells?<br>
 or are you yourself made of different stuff from us?--You ought
to<br>
 have left the office as soon as you found that you were no
longer a<br>
 man, but a temperament. If you have complicated your crime with
such<br>
 gross folly, you will end--I will not say where----"</p>

<p>"Promise me, Cottin, that you will do what you can for her,"
said the<br>
 Marshal, who heard nothing, and was still thinking of his
sister-in-<br>
 law.</p>

<p>"Depend on me,!" said the Minister.</p>

<p>"Thank you, and good-bye then!--Come, monsieur," he said to
his<br>
 brother.</p>

<p>The Prince looked with apparent calmness at the two brothers,
so<br>
 different in their demeanor, conduct, and character--the brave
man and<br>
 the coward, the ascetic and the profligate, the honest man and
the<br>
 peculator--and he said to himself:</p>

<p>"That mean creature will not have courage to die! And my poor
Hulot,<br>
 such an honest fellow! has death in his knapsack, I know!"</p>

<p>He sat down again in his big chair and went on reading the
despatches<br>
 from Africa with a look characteristic at once of the coolness
of a<br>
 leader and of the pity roused by the sight of a battle-field!
For in<br>
 reality no one is so humane as a soldier, stern as he may seem
in the<br>
 icy determination acquired by the habit of fighting, and so
absolutely<br>
 essential in the battle-field.</p>

<p>Next morning some of the newspapers contained, under various
headings,<br>
 the following paragraphs:--</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Monsieur le Baron Hulot d'Ervy has applied for his
retiring<br>
 pension. The unsatisfactory state of the Algerian exchequer,
which<br>
 has come out in consequence of the death and disappearance of
two<br>
 employes, has had some share in this distinguished
official's<br>
 decision. On hearing of the delinquencies of the agents whom
he<br>
 had unfortunately trusted, Monsieur le Baron Hulot had a
paralytic<br>
 stroke in the War Minister's private room.</p>

<p>"Monsieur Hulot d'Ervy, brother to the Marshal Comte de
Forzheim,<br>
 has been forty-five years in the service. His determination
has<br>
 been vainly opposed, and is greatly regretted by all who
know<br>
 Monsieur Hulot, whose private virtues are as conspicuous as
his<br>
 administrative capacity. No one can have forgotten the
devoted<br>
 conduct of the Commissary General of the Imperial Guard at
Warsaw,<br>
 or the marvelous promptitude with which he organized supplies
for<br>
 the various sections of the army so suddenly required by
Napoleon<br>
 in 1815.</p>

<p>"One more of the heroes of the Empire is retiring from the
stage.<br>
 Monsieur le Baron Hulot has never ceased, since 1830, to be one
of<br>
 the guiding lights of the State Council and of the War
Office."</p>

<p>"ALGIERS.--The case known as the forage supply case, to which
some<br>
 of our contemporaries have given absurd prominence, has been<br>
 closed by the death of the chief culprit. Johann Wisch has<br>
 committed suicide in his cell; his accomplice, who had
absconded,<br>
 will be sentenced in default.</p>

<p>"Wisch, formerly an army contractor, was an honest man and
highly<br>
 respected, who could not survive the idea of having been the
dupe<br>
 of Chardin, the storekeeper who has disappeared."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And in the <i>Paris News</i> the following paragraph
appeared:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><br>
 "Monsieur le Marechal the Minister of War, to prevent the<br>
 recurrence of such scandals for the future, has arranged for
a<br>
 regular Commissariat office in Africa. A head-clerk in the
War<br>
 Office, Monsieur Marneffe, is spoken of as likely to be
appointed<br>
 to the post of director."</p>

<p> </p>

<p>"The office vacated by Baron Hulot is the object of much
ambition.<br>
 The appointment is promised, it is said, to Monsieur le
Comte<br>
 Martial de la Roche-Hugon, Deputy, brother-in-law to Monsieur
le<br>
 Comte de Rastignac. Monsieur Massol, Master of Appeals, will
fill<br>
 his seat on the Council of State, and Monsieur Claude Vignon<br>
 becomes Master of Appeals."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Of all kinds of false gossip, the most dangerous for the
Opposition<br>
 newspapers is the official bogus paragraph. However keen
journalists<br>
 may be, they are sometimes the voluntary or involuntary dupes of
the<br>
 cleverness of those who have risen from the ranks of the Press,
like<br>
 Claude Vignon, to the higher realms of power. The newspaper can
only<br>
 be circumvented by the journalist. It may be said, as a parody
on a<br>
 line by Voltaire:</p>

<p><br>
 "The Paris news is never what the foolish folk believe."</p>

<p>Marshal Hulot drove home with his brother, who took the front
seat,<br>
 respectfully leaving the whole of the back of the carriage to
his<br>
 senior. The two men spoke not a word. Hector was helpless. The
Marshal<br>
 was lost in thought, like a man who is collecting all his
strength,<br>
 and bracing himself to bear a crushing weight. On arriving at
his own<br>
 house, still without speaking, but by an imperious gesture,
he<br>
 beckoned his brother into his study. The Count had received from
the<br>
 Emperor Napoleon a splendid pair of pistols from the
Versailles<br>
 factory; he took the box, with its inscription. "<i>Given by the
Emperor<br>
 Napoleon to General Hulot</i>," out of his desk, and placing it
on the<br>
 top, he showed it to his brother, saying, "There is your
remedy."</p>

<p>Lisbeth, peeping through the chink of the door, flew down to
the<br>
 carriage and ordered the coachman to go as fast as he could
gallop to<br>
 the Rue Plumet. Within about twenty minutes she had brought
back<br>
 Adeline, whom she had told of the Marshal's threat to his
brother.</p>

<p>The Marshal, without looking at Hector, rang the bell for
his<br>
 factotum, the old soldier who had served him for thirty
years.</p>

<p>"Beau-Pied," said he, "fetch my notary, and Count Steinbock,
and my<br>
 niece Hortense, and the stockbroker to the Treasury. It is now
half-<br>
 past ten; they must all be here by twelve. Take hackney
cabs--and go<br>
 faster than <i>that</i>!" he added, a republican allusion which
in past<br>
 days had been often on his lips. And he put on the scowl that
had<br>
 brought his soldiers to attention when he was beating the broom
on the<br>
 heaths of Brittany in 1799. (See <i>Les Chouans.</i>)</p>

<p>"You shall be obeyed, Marechal," said Beau-Pied, with a
military<br>
 salute.</p>

<p>Still paying no heed to his brother, the old man came back
into his<br>
 study, took a key out of his desk, and opened a little malachite
box<br>
 mounted in steel, the gift of the Emperor Alexander.</p>

<p>By Napoleon's orders he had gone to restore to the Russian
Emperor the<br>
 private property seized at the battle of Dresden, in exchange
for<br>
 which Napoleon hoped to get back Vandamme. The Czar rewarded
General<br>
 Hulot very handsomely, giving him this casket, and saying that
he<br>
 hoped one day to show the same courtesy to the Emperor of the
French;<br>
 but he kept Vandamme. The Imperial arms of Russia were displayed
in<br>
 gold on the lid of the box, which was inlaid with gold.</p>

<p>The Marshal counted the bank-notes it contained; he had a
hundred and<br>
 fifty-two thousand francs. He saw this with satisfaction. At the
same<br>
 moment Madame Hulot came into the room in a state to touch the
heart<br>
 of the sternest judge. She flew into Hector's arms, looking<br>
 alternately with a crazy eye at the Marshal and at the case
of<br>
 pistols.</p>

<p>"What have you to say against your brother? What has my
husband done<br>
 to you?" said she, in such a voice that the Marshal heard
her.</p>

<p>"He has disgraced us all!" replied the Republican veteran, who
spoke<br>
 with a vehemence that reopened one of his old wounds. "He has
robbed<br>
 the Government! He has cast odium on my name, he makes me wish I
were<br>
 dead--he has killed me!--I have only strength enough left to
make<br>
 restitution!</p>

<p>"I have been abased before the Conde of the Republic, the man
I esteem<br>
 above all others, and to whom I unjustifiably gave the lie--the
Prince<br>
 of Wissembourg!--Is that nothing? That is the score his country
has<br>
 against him!"</p>

<p>He wiped away a tear.</p>

<p>"Now, as to his family," he went on. "He is robbing you of the
bread I<br>
 had saved for you, the fruit of thirty years' economy, of
the<br>
 privations of an old soldier! Here is what was intended for
you," and<br>
 he held up the bank-notes. "He has killed his Uncle Fischer, a
noble<br>
 and worthy son of Alsace who could not--as he can--endure the
thought<br>
 of a stain on his peasant's honor.</p>

<p>"To crown all, God, in His adorable clemency, had allowed him
to<br>
 choose an angel among women; he has had the unspeakable
happiness of<br>
 having an Adeline for his wife! And he has deceived her, he has
soaked<br>
 her in sorrows, he has neglected her for prostitutes, for
street-<br>
 hussies, for ballet-girls, actresses--Cadine, Josepha,
Marneffe!--And<br>
 that is the brother I treated as a son and made my pride!</p>

<p>"Go, wretched man; if you can accept the life of degradation
you have<br>
 made for yourself, leave my house! I have not the heart to curse
a<br>
 brother I have loved so well--I am as foolish about him as you
are,<br>
 Adeline--but never let me see him again. I forbid his attending
my<br>
 funeral or following me to the grave. Let him show the decency
of a<br>
 criminal if he can feel no remorse."</p>

<p>The Marshal, as pale as death, fell back on the settee,
exhausted by<br>
 his solemn speech. And, for the first time in his life perhaps,
tears<br>
 gathered in his eyes and rolled down his cheeks.</p>

<p>"My poor uncle!" cried Lisbeth, putting a handkerchief to her
eyes.</p>

<p>"Brother!" said Adeline, kneeling down by the Marshal, "live
for my<br>
 sake. Help me in the task of reconciling Hector to the world
and<br>
 making him redeem the past."</p>

<p>"He!" cried the Marshal. "If he lives, he is not at the end of
his<br>
 crimes. A man who has misprized an Adeline, who has smothered in
his<br>
 own soul the feelings of a true Republican which I tried to
instill<br>
 into him, the love of his country, of his family, and of the
poor--<br>
 that man is a monster, a swine!--Take him away if you still care
for<br>
 him, for a voice within me cries to me to load my pistols and
blow his<br>
 brains out. By killing him I should save you all, and I should
save<br>
 him too from himself."</p>

<p>The old man started to his feet with such a terrifying gesture
that<br>
 poor Adeline exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Hector--come!"</p>

<p>She seized her husband's arm, dragged him away, and out of the
house;<br>
 but the Baron was so broken down, that she was obliged to call a
coach<br>
 to take him to the Rue Plumet, where he went to bed. The man
remained<br>
 there for several days in a sort of half-dissolution, refusing
all<br>
 nourishment without a word. By floods of tears, Adeline
persuaded him<br>
 to swallow a little broth; she nursed him, sitting by his bed,
and<br>
 feeling only, of all the emotions that once had filled her
heart, the<br>
 deepest pity for him.</p>

<p>At half-past twelve, Lisbeth showed into her dear Marshal's
room--for<br>
 she would not leave him, so much was she alarmed at the evident
change<br>
 in him--Count Steinbock and the notary.</p>

<p>"Monsieur le Comte," said the Marshal, "I would beg you to be
so good<br>
 as to put your signature to a document authorizing my niece,
your<br>
 wife, to sell a bond for certain funds of which she at present
holds<br>
 only the reversion.--You, Mademoiselle Fischer, will agree to
this<br>
 sale, thus losing your life interest in the securities."</p>

<p>"Yes, dear Count," said Lisbeth without hesitation.</p>

<p>"Good, my dear," said the old soldier. "I hope I may live to
reward<br>
 you. But I did not doubt you; you are a true Republican, a
daughter of<br>
 the people." He took the old maid's hand and kissed it.</p>

<p>"Monsieur Hannequin," he went on, speaking to the notary,
"draw up the<br>
 necessary document in the form of a power of attorney, and let
me have<br>
 it within two hours, so that I may sell the stock on the
Bourse<br>
 to-day. My niece, the Countess, holds the security; she will be
here<br>
 to sign the power of attorney when you bring it, and so will<br>
 mademoiselle. Monsieur le Comte will be good enough to go with
you and<br>
 sign it at your office."</p>

<p>The artist, at a nod from Lisbeth, bowed respectfully to the
Marshal<br>
 and went away.</p>

<p>Next morning, at ten o'clock, the Comte de Forzheim sent in
to<br>
 announce himself to the Prince, and was at once admitted.</p>

<p>"Well, my dear Hulot," said the Prince, holding out the
newspapers to<br>
 his old friend, "we have saved appearances, you see.--Read."</p>

<p>Marshal Hulot laid the papers on his comrade's table, and held
out to<br>
 him the two hundred thousand francs.</p>

<p>"Here is the money of which my brother robbed the State," said
he.</p>

<p>"What madness!" cried the Minister. "It is impossible," he
said into<br>
 the speaking-trumpet handed to him by the Marshal, "to manage
this<br>
 restitution. We should be obliged to declare your brother's
dishonest<br>
 dealings, and we have done everything to hide them."</p>

<p>"Do what you like with the money; but the family shall not owe
one sou<br>
 of its fortune to a robbery on the funds of the State," said
the<br>
 Count.</p>

<p>"I will take the King's commands in the matter. We will
discuss it no<br>
 further," replied the Prince, perceiving that it would be
impossible<br>
 to conquer the old man's sublime obstinacy on the point.</p>

<p>"Good-bye, Cottin," said the old soldier, taking the Prince's
hand. "I<br>
 feel as if my soul were frozen--"</p>

<p>Then, after going a step towards the door, he turned round,
looked at<br>
 the Prince, and seeing that he was deeply moved, he opened his
arms to<br>
 clasp him in them; the two old soldiers embraced each other.</p>

<p>"I feel as if I were taking leave of the whole of the old army
in<br>
 you," said the Count.</p>

<p>"Good-bye, my good old comrade!" said the Minister.</p>

<p>"Yes, it is good-bye; for I am going where all our brave men
are for<br>
 whom we have mourned--"</p>

<p>Just then Claude Vignon was shown in. The two relics of the
Napoleonic<br>
 phalanx bowed gravely to each other, effacing every trace of
emotion.</p>

<p>"You have, I hope, been satisfied by the papers," said the
Master of<br>
 Appeals-elect. "I contrived to let the Opposition papers believe
that<br>
 they were letting out our secrets."</p>

<p>"Unfortunately, it is all in vain," replied the Minister,
watching<br>
 Hulot as he left the room. "I have just gone through a
leave-taking<br>
 that has been a great grief to me. For, indeed, Marshal Hulot
has not<br>
 three days to live; I saw that plainly enough yesterday. That
man, one<br>
 of those honest souls that are above proof, a soldier respected
by the<br>
 bullets in spite of his valor, received his death-blow--there,
in that<br>
 armchair--and dealt by my hand, in a letter!--Ring and order
my<br>
 carriage. I must go to Neuilly," said he, putting the two
hundred<br>
 thousand francs into his official portfolio.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding Lisbeth's nursing, Marshal Hulot three days
later was<br>
 a dead man. Such men are the glory of the party they support.
To<br>
 Republicans, the Marshal was the ideal of patriotism; and they
all<br>
 attended his funeral, which was followed by an immense crowd.
The<br>
 army, the State officials, the Court, and the populace all came
to do<br>
 homage to this lofty virtue, this spotless honesty, this
immaculate<br>
 glory. Such a last tribute of the people is not a thing to be
had for<br>
 the asking.</p>

<p>This funeral was distinguished by one of those tributes of
delicate<br>
 feeling, of good taste, and sincere respect which from time to
time<br>
 remind us of the virtues and dignity of the old French
nobility.<br>
 Following the Marshal's bier came the old Marquis de Montauran,
the<br>
 brother of him who, in the great rising of the Chouans in 1799,
had<br>
 been the foe, the luckless foe, of Hulot. That Marquis, killed
by the<br>
 balls of the "Blues," had confided the interests of his young
brother<br>
 to the Republican soldier. (See <i>Les Chouans</i>.) Hulot had
so<br>
 faithfully acted on the noble Royalist's verbal will, that
he<br>
 succeeded in saving the young man's estates, though he himself
was at<br>
 the time an emigre. And so the homage of the old French nobility
was<br>
 not wanting to the leader who, nine years since, had conquered
MADAME.</p>

<p>This death, happening just four days before the banns were
cried for<br>
 the last time, came upon Lisbeth like the thunderbolt that burns
the<br>
 garnered harvest with the barn. The peasant of Lorraine, as
often<br>
 happens, had succeeded too well. The Marshal had died of the
blows<br>
 dealt to the family by herself and Madame Marneffe.</p>

<p>The old maid's vindictiveness, which success seemed to have
somewhat<br>
 mollified, was aggravated by this disappointment of her hopes.
Lisbeth<br>
 went, crying with rage, to Madame Marneffe; for she was
homeless, the<br>
 Marshal having agreed that his lease was at any time to
terminate with<br>
 his life. Crevel, to console Valerie's friend, took charge of
her<br>
 savings, added to them considerably, and invested the capital in
five<br>
 per cents, giving her the life interest, and putting the
securities<br>
 into Celestine's name. Thanks to this stroke of business,
Lisbeth had<br>
 an income of about two thousand francs.</p>

<p><br>
 When the Marshal's property was examined and valued, a note was
found,<br>
 addressed to his sister-in-law, to his niece Hortense, and to
his<br>
 nephew Victorin, desiring that they would pay among them an
annuity of<br>
 twelve hundred francs to Mademoiselle Lisbeth Fischer, who was
to have<br>
 been his wife.</p>

<p>Adeline, seeing her husband between life and death, succeeded
for some<br>
 days in hiding from him the fact of his brother's death; but
Lisbeth<br>
 came, in mourning, and the terrible truth was told him eleven
days<br>
 after the funeral.</p>

<p>The crushing blow revived the sick man's energies. He got up,
found<br>
 his family collected in the drawing-room, all in black, and
suddenly<br>
 silent as he came in. In a fortnight, Hulot, as lean as a
spectre,<br>
 looked to his family the mere shadow of himself.</p>

<p>"I must decide on something," said he in a husky voice, as he
seated<br>
 himself in an easy-chair, and looked round at the party, of
whom<br>
 Crevel and Steinbock were absent.</p>

<p>"We cannot stay here, the rent is too high," Hortense was
saying just<br>
 as her father came in.</p>

<p>"As to a home," said Victorin, breaking the painful silence,
"I can<br>
 offer my mother----"</p>

<p>As he heard these words, which excluded him, the Baron raised
his<br>
 head, which was sunk on his breast as though he were studying
the<br>
 pattern of the carpet, though he did not even see it, and he
gave the<br>
 young lawyer an appealing look. The rights of a father are
so<br>
 indefeasibly sacred, even when he is a villain and devoid of
honor,<br>
 that Victorin paused.</p>

<p>"To your mother," the Baron repeated. "You are right, my
son."</p>

<p>"The rooms over ours in our wing," said Celestine, finishing
her<br>
 husband's sentence.</p>

<p>"I am in your way, my dears?" said the Baron, with the
mildness of a<br>
 man who has judged himself. "But do not be uneasy as to the
future;<br>
 you will have no further cause for complaint of your father; you
will<br>
 not see him till the time when you need no longer blush for
him."</p>

<p>He went up to Hortense and kissed her brow. He opened his arms
to his<br>
 son, who rushed into his embrace, guessing his father's purpose.
The<br>
 Baron signed to Lisbeth, who came to him, and he kissed her
forehead.<br>
 Then he went to his room, whither Adeline followed him in an
agony of<br>
 dread.</p>

<p>"My brother was quite right, Adeline," he said, holding her
hand. "I<br>
 am unworthy of my home life. I dared not bless my children, who
have<br>
 behaved so nobly, but in my heart; tell them that I could only
venture<br>
 to kiss them; for the blessing of a bad man, a father who has
been an<br>
 assassin and the scourge of his family instead of its protector
and<br>
 its glory, might bring evil on them; but assure them that I
shall<br>
 bless them every day.--As to you, God alone, for He is Almighty,
can<br>
 ever reward you according to your merits!--I can only ask
your<br>
 forgiveness!" and he knelt at her feet, taking her hands and
wetting<br>
 them with his tears.</p>

<p>"Hector, Hector! Your sins have been great, but Divine Mercy
is<br>
 infinite, and you may repair all by staying with me.--Rise up
in<br>
 Christian charity, my dear--I am your wife, and not your judge.
I am<br>
 your possession; do what you will with me; take me wherever you
go, I<br>
 feel strong enough comfort you, to make life endurable to you,
by the<br>
 strength of my love, my care, and respect.--Our children are
settled<br>
 in life; they need me no more. Let me try to be an amusement to
you,<br>
 an occupation. Let me share the pain of your banishment and of
your<br>
 poverty, and help to mitigate it. I could always be of some use,
if it<br>
 were only to save the expense of a servant."</p>

<p>"Can you forgive, my dearly-beloved Adeline?"</p>

<p>"Yes, only get up, my dear!"</p>

<p>"Well, with that forgiveness I can live," said he, rising to
his feet.<br>
 "I came back into this room that my children should not see
their<br>
 father's humiliation. Oh! the sight constantly before their eyes
of a<br>
 father so guilty as I am is a terrible thing; it must
undermine<br>
 parental influence and break every family tie. So I cannot
remain<br>
 among you, and I must go to spare you the odious spectacle of a
father<br>
 bereft of dignity. Do not oppose my departure Adeline. It would
only<br>
 be to load with your own hand the pistol to blow my brains out.
Above<br>
 all, do not seek me in my hiding-place; you would deprive me of
the<br>
 only strong motive remaining in me, that of remorse."</p>

<p>Hector's decisiveness silenced his dejected wife. Adeline,
lofty in<br>
 the midst of all this ruin, had derived her courage from her
perfect<br>
 union with her husband; for she had dreamed of having him for
her own,<br>
 of the beautiful task of comforting him, of leading him back to
family<br>
 life, and reconciling him to himself.</p>

<p>"But, Hector, would you leave me to die of despair, anxiety,
and<br>
 alarms!" said she, seeing herself bereft of the mainspring of
her<br>
 strength.</p>

<p>"I will come back to you, dear angel--sent from Heaven
expressly for<br>
 me, I believe. I will come back, if not rich, at least with
enough to<br>
 live in ease.--Listen, my sweet Adeline, I cannot stay here for
many<br>
 reasons. In the first place, my pension of six thousand francs
is<br>
 pledged for four years, so I have nothing. That is not all. I
shall be<br>
 committed to prison within a few days in consequence of the
bills held<br>
 by Vauvinet. So I must keep out of the way until my son, to whom
I<br>
 will give full instructions, shall have bought in the bills.
My<br>
 disappearance will facilitate that. As soon as my pension is my
own,<br>
 and Vauvinet is paid off, I will return to you.--You would be
sure to<br>
 let out the secret of my hiding-place. Be calm; do not cry,
Adeline--<br>
 it is only for a month--"</p>

<p>"Where will you go? What will you do? What will become of you?
Who<br>
 will take care of you now that you are no longer young? Let me
go with<br>
 you--we will go abroad--" said she.</p>

<p>"Well, well, we will see," he replied.</p>

<p>The Baron rang and ordered Mariette to collect all his things
and pack<br>
 them quickly and secretly. Then, after embracing his wife with
a<br>
 warmth of affection to which she was unaccustomed, he begged her
to<br>
 leave him alone for a few minutes while he wrote his
instructions for<br>
 Victorin, promising that he would not leave the house till dark,
or<br>
 without her.</p>

<p>As soon as the Baroness was in the drawing-room, the cunning
old man<br>
 stole out through the dressing-closet to the anteroom, and went
away,<br>
 giving Mariette a slip of paper, on which was written, "Address
my<br>
 trunks to go by railway to Corbeil--to Monsieur Hector,
cloak-room,<br>
 Corbeil."</p>

<p>The Baron jumped into a hackney coach, and was rushing across
Paris by<br>
 the time Mariette came to give the Baroness this note, and say
that<br>
 her master had gone out. Adeline flew back into her room,
trembling<br>
 more violently than ever; her children followed on hearing her
give a<br>
 piercing cry. They found her in a dead faint; and they put her
to bed,<br>
 for she was seized by a nervous fever which held her for a
month<br>
 between life and death.</p>

<p>"Where is he?" was the only thing she would say.</p>

<p>Victorin sought for him in vain.</p>

<p>And this is why. The Baron had driven to the Place du Palais
Royal.<br>
 There this man, who had recovered all his wits to work out a
scheme<br>
 which he had premeditated during the days he had spent crushed
with<br>
 pain and grief, crossed the Palais Royal on foot, and took a
handsome<br>
 carriage from a livery-stable in the Rue Joquelet. In obedience
to his<br>
 orders, the coachman went to the Rue de la Ville l'Eveque, and
into<br>
 the courtyard of Josepha's mansion, the gates opening at once at
the<br>
 call of the driver of such a splendid vehicle. Josepha came
out,<br>
 prompted by curiosity, for her man-servant had told her that
a<br>
 helpless old gentleman, unable to get out of his carriage,
begged her<br>
 to come to him for a moment.</p>

<p>"Josepha!--it is I----"</p>

<p>The singer recognized her Hulot only by his voice.</p>

<p>"What? you, poor old man?--On my honor, you look like a
twenty-franc<br>
 piece that the Jews have sweated and the money-changers
refuse."</p>

<p>"Alas, yes," replied Hulot; "I am snatched from the jaws of
death! But<br>
 you are as lovely as ever. Will you be kind?"</p>

<p>"That depends," said she; "everything is relative."</p>

<p>"Listen," said Hulot; "can you put me up for a few days in a
servant's<br>
 room under the roof? I have nothing--not a farthing, not a hope;
no<br>
 food, no pension, no wife, no children, no roof over my head;
without<br>
 honor, without courage, without a friend; and worse than all
that,<br>
 liable to imprisonment for not meeting a bill."</p>

<p>"Poor old fellow! you are without most things.--Are you also
<i>sans</i><br>
 <i>culotte</i>?"</p>

<p>"You laugh at me! I am done for," cried the Baron. "And I
counted on<br>
 you as Gourville did on Ninon."</p>

<p>"And it was a 'real lady,' I am told who brought you to this,"
said<br>
 Josepha. "Those precious sluts know how to pluck a goose even
better<br>
 than we do!--Why, you are like a corpse that the crows have done
with<br>
 --I can see daylight through!"</p>

<p>"Time is short, Josepha!"</p>

<p>"Come in, old boy, I am alone, as it happens, and my people
don't know<br>
 you. Send away your trap. Is it paid for?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said the Baron, getting out with the help of Josepha's
arm.</p>

<p>"You may call yourself my father if you like," said the
singer, moved<br>
 to pity.</p>

<p>She made Hulot sit down in the splendid drawing-room where he
had last<br>
 seen her.</p>

<p>"And is it the fact, old man," she went on, "that you have
killed your<br>
 brother and your uncle, ruined your family, mortgaged your
children's<br>
 house over and over again, and robbed the Government till in
Africa,<br>
 all for your princess?"</p>

<p>Hulot sadly bent his head.</p>

<p>"Well, I admire that!" cried Josepha, starting up in her
enthusiasm.<br>
 "It is a general flare-up! It is Sardanapalus! Splendid,
thoroughly<br>
 complete! I may be a hussy, but I have a soul! I tell you, I
like a<br>
 spendthrift, like you, crazy over a woman, a thousand times
better<br>
 than those torpid, heartless bankers, who are supposed to be so
good,<br>
 and who ruin no end of families with their rails--gold for them,
and<br>
 iron for their gulls! You have only ruined those who belong to
you,<br>
 you have sold no one but yourself; and then you have excuses,
physical<br>
 and moral."</p>

<p>She struck a tragic attitude, and spouted:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>" 'Tis Venus whose grasp never parts from her prey.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And there you are!" and she pirouetted on her toe.</p>

<p>Vice, Hulot found, could forgive him; vice smiled on him from
the<br>
 midst of unbridled luxury. Here, as before a jury, the magnitude
of a<br>
 crime was an extenuating circumstance. "And is your lady pretty
at any<br>
 rate?" asked Josepha, trying as a preliminary act of charity,
to<br>
 divert Hulot's thoughts, for his depression grieved her.</p>

<p><br>
 "On my word, almost as pretty as you are," said the Baron
artfully.</p>

<p>"And monstrously droll? So I have been told. What does she do,
I say?<br>
 Is she better fun than I am?"</p>

<p>"I don't want to talk about her," said Hulot.</p>

<p>"And I hear she has come round my Crevel, and little
Steinbock, and a<br>
 gorgeous Brazilian?"</p>

<p>"Very likely."</p>

<p>"And that she has got a house as good as this, that Crevel has
given<br>
 her. The baggage! She is my provost-marshal, and finishes off
those I<br>
 have spoiled. I tell you why I am so curious to know what she is
like,<br>
 old boy; I just caught sight of her in the Bois, in an open
carriage--<br>
 but a long way off. She is a most accomplished harpy, Carabine
says.<br>
 She is trying to eat up Crevel, but he only lets her nibble.
Crevel is<br>
 a knowing hand, good-natured but hard-headed, who will always
say Yes,<br>
 and then go his own way. He is vain and passionate; but his cash
is<br>
 cold. You can never get anything out of such fellows beyond a
thousand<br>
 to three thousand francs a month; they jib at any serious
outlay, as a<br>
 donkey does at a running stream.</p>

<p>"Not like you, old boy. You are a man of passions; you would
sell your<br>
 country for a woman. And, look here, I am ready to do anything
for<br>
 you! You are my father; you started me in life; it is a sacred
duty.<br>
 What do you want? Do you want a hundred thousand francs? I will
wear<br>
 myself to a rag to gain them. As to giving you bed and
board--that is<br>
 nothing. A place will be laid for you here every day; you can
have a<br>
 good room on the second floor, and a hundred crowns a month
for<br>
 pocket-money."</p>

<p>The Baron, deeply touched by such a welcome, had a last qualm
of<br>
 honor.</p>

<p>"No, my dear child, no; I did not come here for you to keep
me," said<br>
 he.</p>

<p>"At your age it is something to be proud of," said she.</p>

<p>"This is what I wish, my child. Your Duc d'Herouville has
immense<br>
 estates in Normandy, and I want to be his steward, under the
name of<br>
 Thoul. I have the capacity, and I am honest. A man may borrow of
the<br>
 Government, and yet not steal from a cash-box----"</p>

<p>"H'm, h'm," said Josepha. "Once drunk, drinks again."</p>

<p>"In short, I only want to live out of sight for three
years--"</p>

<p>"Well, it is soon done," said Josepha. "This evening, after
dinner, I<br>
 have only to speak. The Duke would marry me if I wished it, but
I have<br>
 his fortune, and I want something better--his esteem. He is a
Duke of<br>
 the first water. He is high-minded, as noble and great as Louis
XIV.<br>
 and Napoleon rolled into one, though he is a dwarf. Besides, I
have<br>
 done for him what la Schontz did for Rochefide; by taking my
advice he<br>
 has made two millions.</p>

<p>"Now, listen to me, old popgun. I know you; you are always
after the<br>
 women, and you would be dancing attendance on the Normandy
girls, who<br>
 are splendid creatures, and getting your ribs cracked by their
lovers<br>
 and fathers, and the Duke would have to get you out of the
scrape.<br>
 Why, can't I see by the way you look at me that the <i>young</i>
man is not<br>
 dead in you--as Fenelon put it.--No, this stewardship is not the
thing<br>
 for you. A man cannot be off with his Paris and with us, old
boy, for<br>
 the saying! You would die of weariness at Herouville."</p>

<p>"What is to become of me?" said the Baron, "for I will only
stay here<br>
 till I see my way."</p>

<p>"Well, shall I find a pigeon-hole for you? Listen, you old
pirate.<br>
 Women are what you want. They are consolation in all
circumstances.<br>
 Attend now.--At the end of the Alley, Rue Saint-Maur-du-Temple,
there<br>
 is a poor family I know of where there is a jewel of a little
girl,<br>
 prettier than I was at sixteen.--Ah! there is a twinkle in your
eye<br>
 already!--The child works sixteen hours a day at embroidering
costly<br>
 pieces for the silk merchants, and earns sixteen sous a day--one
sou<br>
 an hour!--and feeds like the Irish, on potatoes fried in
rats'<br>
 dripping, with bread five times a week--and drinks canal water
out of<br>
 the town pipes, because the Seine water costs too much; and she
cannot<br>
 set up on her own account for lack of six or seven thousand
francs.<br>
 Your wife and children bore you to death, don't they?--Besides,
one<br>
 cannot submit to be nobody where one has been a little Almighty.
A<br>
 father who has neither money nor honor can only be stuffed and
kept in<br>
 a glass case."</p>

<p>The Baron could not help smiling at these abominable
jests.</p>

<p>"Well, now, Bijou is to come to-morrow morning to bring me
an<br>
 embroidered wrapper, a gem! It has taken six months to make; no
one<br>
 else will have any stuff like it! Bijou is very fond of me; I
give her<br>
 tidbits and my old gowns. And I send orders for bread and meat
and<br>
 wood to the family, who would break the shin-bones of the first
comer<br>
 if I bid them.--I try to do a little good. Ah! I know what I
endured<br>
 from hunger myself!--Bijou has confided to me all her little
sorrows.<br>
 There is the making of a super at the Ambigu-Comique in that
child.<br>
 Her dream is to wear fine dresses like mine; above all, to ride
in a<br>
 carriage. I shall say to her, 'Look here, little one, would you
like<br>
 to have a friend of--' How old are you?" she asked,
interrupting<br>
 herself. "Seventy-two?"</p>

<p>"I have given up counting."</p>

<p>" 'Would you like an old gentleman of seventy-two?' I shall
say. 'Very<br>
 clean and neat, and who does not take snuff, who is as sound as
a<br>
 bell, and as good as a young man? He will marry you (in the
Thirteenth<br>
 Arrondissement) and be very kind to you; he will place seven
thousand<br>
 francs in your account, and furnish you a room all in mahogany,
and if<br>
 you are good, he will sometimes take you to the play. He will
give you<br>
 a hundred francs a month for pocket-money, and fifty francs
for<br>
 housekeeping.'--I know Bijou; she is myself at fourteen. I
jumped for<br>
 joy when that horrible Crevel made me his atrocious offers.
Well, and<br>
 you, old man, will be disposed of for three years. She is a
good<br>
 child, well behaved; for three or four years she will have
her<br>
 illusions--not for longer."</p>

<p>Hulot did not hesitate; he had made up his mind to refuse; but
to seem<br>
 grateful to the kind-hearted singer, who was benevolent after
her<br>
 lights, he affected to hesitate between vice and virtue.</p>

<p>"Why, you are as cold as a paving-stone in winter!" she
exclaimed in<br>
 amazement. "Come, now. You will make a whole family happy--a<br>
 grandfather who runs all the errands, a mother who is being worn
out<br>
 with work, and two sisters--one of them very plain--who make
thirty-<br>
 two sous a day while putting their eyes out. It will make up for
the<br>
 misery you have caused at home, and you will expiate your sin
while<br>
 you are having as much fun as a minx at Mabille."</p>

<p>Hulot, to put an end to this temptation, moved his fingers as
if he<br>
 were counting out money.</p>

<p>"Oh! be quite easy as to ways and means," replied Josepha. "My
Duke<br>
 will lend you ten thousand francs; seven thousand to start
an<br>
 embroidery shop in Bijou's name, and three thousand for
furnishing;<br>
 and every three months you will find a cheque here for six
hundred and<br>
 fifty francs. When you get your pension paid you, you can repay
the<br>
 seventeen thousand francs. Meanwhile you will be as happy as a
cow in<br>
 clover, and hidden in a hole where the police will never find
you. You<br>
 must wear a loose serge coat, and you will look like a
comfortable<br>
 householder. Call yourself Thoul, if that is your fancy. I will
tell<br>
 Bijou that you are an uncle of mine come from Germany, having
failed<br>
 in business, and you will be cosseted like a divinity.--There
now,<br>
 Daddy!--And who knows! you may have no regrets. In case you
should be<br>
 bored, keep one Sunday rig-out, and you can come and ask me for
a<br>
 dinner and spend the evening here."</p>

<p>"I!--and I meant to settle down and behave myself!--Look here,
borrow<br>
 twenty thousand francs for me, and I will set out to make my
fortune<br>
 in America, like my friend d'Aiglemont when Nucingen cleaned him
out."</p>

<p>"You!" cried Josepha. "Nay, leave morals to work-a-day folks,
to raw<br>
 recruits, to the <i>worrrthy</i> citizens who have nothing to
boast of but<br>
 their virtue. You! You were born to be something better than
a<br>
 nincompoop; you are as a man what I am as a woman--a spendthrift
of<br>
 genius."</p>

<p>"We will sleep on it and discuss it all to-morrow
morning."</p>

<p>"You will dine with the Duke. My d'Herouville will receive you
as<br>
 civilly as if you were the saviour of the State; and to-morrow
you can<br>
 decide. Come, be jolly, old boy! Life is a garment; when it is
dirty,<br>
 we must brush it; when it is ragged, it must be patched; but we
keep<br>
 it on as long as we can."</p>

<p>This philosophy of life, and her high spirits, postponed
Hulot's<br>
 keenest pangs.</p>

<p>At noon next day, after a capital breakfast, Hulot saw the
arrival of<br>
 one of those living masterpieces which Paris alone of all the
cities<br>
 in the world can produce, by means of the constant concubinage
of<br>
 luxury and poverty, of vice and decent honesty, of suppressed
desire<br>
 and renewed temptation, which makes the French capital the
daughter of<br>
 Ninevah, of Babylon, and of Imperial Rome.</p>

<p>Mademoiselle Olympe Bijou, a child of sixteen, had the
exquisite face<br>
 which Raphael drew for his Virgins; eyes of pathetic innocence,
weary<br>
 with overwork--black eyes, with long lashes, their moisture
parched<br>
 with the heat of laborious nights, and darkened with fatigue;
a<br>
 complexion like porcelain, almost too delicate; a mouth like a
partly<br>
 opened pomegranate; a heaving bosom, a full figure, pretty
hands, the<br>
 whitest teeth, and a mass of black hair; and the whole meagrely
set<br>
 off by a cotton frock at seventy-five centimes the metre,
leather<br>
 shoes without heels, and the cheapest gloves. The girl, all<br>
 unconscious of her charms, had put on her best frock to wait on
the<br>
 fine lady.</p>

<p>The Baron, gripped again by the clutch of profligacy, felt all
his<br>
 life concentrated in his eyes. He forgot everything on beholding
this<br>
 delightful creature. He was like a sportsman in sight of the
game; if<br>
 an emperor were present, he must take aim!</p>

<p>"And warranted sound," said Josepha in his ear. "An honest
child, and<br>
 wanting bread. This is Paris--I have been there!"</p>

<p>"It is a bargain," replied the old man, getting up and rubbing
his<br>
 hands.</p>

<p>When Olympe Bijou was gone, Josepha looked mischievously at
the Baron.</p>

<p>"If you want things to keep straight, Daddy," said she, "be as
firm as<br>
 the Public Prosecutor on the bench. Keep a tight hand on her, be
a<br>
 Bartholo! Ware Auguste, Hippolyte, Nestor, Victor--<i>or</i>,
that is gold,<br>
 in every form. When once the child is fed and dressed, if she
gets the<br>
 upper hand, she will drive you like a serf.--I will see to
settling<br>
 you comfortably. The Duke does the handsome; he will lend--that
is,<br>
 give--you ten thousand francs; and he deposits eight thousand
with his<br>
 notary, who will pay you six hundred francs every quarter, for
I<br>
 cannot trust you.--Now, am I nice?"</p>

<p>"Adorable."</p>

<p>Ten days after deserting his family, when they were gathered
round<br>
 Adeline, who seemed to be dying, as she said again and again, in
a<br>
 weak voice, "Where is he?" Hector, under the name of Thoul,
was<br>
 established in the Rue Saint-Maur, at the head of a business
as<br>
 embroiderer, under the name of Thoul and Bijou.</p>

<p>Victorin Hulot, under the overwhelming disasters of his
family, had<br>
 received the finishing touch which makes or mars the man. He
was<br>
 perfection. In the great storms of life we act like the captain
of a<br>
 ship who, under the stress of a hurricane, lightens the ship of
its<br>
 heaviest cargo. The young lawyer lost his self-conscious pride,
his<br>
 too evident assertiveness, his arrogance as an orator and
his<br>
 political pretensions. He was as a man what his wife was as a
woman.<br>
 He made up his mind to make the best of his Celestine--who
certainly<br>
 did not realize his dreams--and was wise enough to estimate life
at<br>
 its true value by contenting himself in all things with the
second<br>
 best. He vowed to fulfil his duties, so much had he been shocked
by<br>
 his father's example.</p>

<p>These feelings were confirmed as he stood by his mother's bed
on the<br>
 day when she was out of danger. Nor did this happiness come
single.<br>
 Claude Vignon, who called every day from the Prince de
Wissembourg to<br>
 inquire as to Madame Hulot's progress, desired the re-elected
deputy<br>
 to go with him to see the Minister.</p>

<p>"His Excellency," said he, "wants to talk over your family
affairs<br>
 with you."</p>

<p>The Prince had long known Victorin Hulot, and received him
with a<br>
 friendliness that promised well.</p>

<p>"My dear fellow," said the old soldier, "I promised your
uncle, in<br>
 this room, that I would take care of your mother. That saintly
woman,<br>
 I am told, is getting well again; now is the time to pour oil
into<br>
 your wounds. I have for you here two hundred thousand francs; I
will<br>
 give them to you----"</p>

<p>The lawyer's gesture was worthy of his uncle the Marshal.</p>

<p>"Be quite easy," said the Prince, smiling; "it is money in
trust. My<br>
 days are numbered; I shall not always be here; so take this sum,
and<br>
 fill my place towards your family. You may use this money to pay
off<br>
 the mortgage on your house. These two hundred thousand francs
are the<br>
 property of your mother and your sister. If I gave the money to
Madame<br>
 Hulot, I fear that, in her devotion to her husband, she would
be<br>
 tempted to waste it. And the intention of those who restore it
to you<br>
 is, that it should produce bread for Madame Hulot and her
daughter,<br>
 the Countess Steinbock. You are a steady man, the worthy son of
your<br>
 noble mother, the true nephew of my friend the Marshal; you
are<br>
 appreciated here, you see--and elsewhere. So be the guardian
angel of<br>
 your family, and take this as a legacy from your uncle and
me."</p>

<p>"Monseigneur," said Hulot, taking the Minister's hand and
pressing it,<br>
 "such men as you know that thanks in words mean nothing;
gratitude<br>
 must be proven."</p>

<p>"Prove yours--" said the old man.</p>

<p>"In what way?"</p>

<p>"By accepting what I have to offer you," said the Minister.
"We<br>
 propose to appoint you to be attorney to the War Office, which
just<br>
 now is involved in litigations in consequence of the plan
for<br>
 fortifying Paris; consulting clerk also to the Prefecture of
Police;<br>
 and a member of the Board of the Civil List. These three
appointments<br>
 will secure you salaries amounting to eighteen thousand francs,
and<br>
 will leave you politically free. You can vote in the Chamber
in<br>
 obedience to your opinions and your conscience. Act in perfect
freedom<br>
 on that score. It would be a bad thing for us if there were
no<br>
 national opposition!</p>

<p>"Also, a few lines from your uncle, written a day or two
before he<br>
 breathed his last, suggested what I could do for your mother,
whom he<br>
 loved very truly.--Mesdames Popinot, de Rastignac, de
Navarreins,<br>
 d'Espard, de Grandlieu, de Carigliano, de Lenoncourt, and de la
Batie<br>
 have made a place for your mother as a Lady Superintendent of
their<br>
 charities. These ladies, presidents of various branches of
benevolent<br>
 work, cannot do everything themselves; they need a lady of
character<br>
 who can act for them by going to see the objects of their
beneficence,<br>
 ascertaining that charity is not imposed upon, and whether the
help<br>
 given really reaches those who applied for it, finding out that
the<br>
 poor who are ashamed to beg, and so forth. Your mother will
fulfil an<br>
 angelic function; she will be thrown in with none but priests
and<br>
 these charitable ladies; she will be paid six thousand francs
and the<br>
 cost of her hackney coaches.</p>

<p>"You see, young man, that a pure and nobly virtuous man can
still<br>
 assist his family, even from the grave. Such a name as your
uncle's<br>
 is, and ought to be, a buckler against misfortune in a
well-organized<br>
 scheme of society. Follow in his path; you have started in it, I
know;<br>
 continue in it."</p>

<p>"Such delicate kindness cannot surprise me in my mother's
friend,"<br>
 said Victorin. "I will try to come up to all your hopes."</p>

<p>"Go at once, and take comfort to your family.--By the way,"
added the<br>
 Prince, as he shook hands with Victorin, "your father has<br>
 disappeared?"</p>

<p>"Alas! yes."</p>

<p>"So much the better. That unhappy man has shown his wit, in
which,<br>
 indeed, he is not lacking."</p>

<p>"There are bills of his to be met."</p>

<p>"Well, you shall have six months' pay of your three
appointments in<br>
 advance. This pre-payment will help you, perhaps, to get the
notes out<br>
 of the hands of the money-lender. And I will see Nucingen, and
perhaps<br>
 may succeed in releasing your father's pension, pledged to
him,<br>
 without its costing you or our office a sou. The peer has not
killed<br>
 the banker in Nucingen; he is insatiable; he wants some
concession.--I<br>
 know not what----"</p>

<p>So on his return to the Rue Plumet, Victorin could carry out
his plan<br>
 of lodging his mother and sister under his roof.</p>

<p>The young lawyer, already famous, had, for his sole fortune,
one of<br>
 the handsomest houses in Paris, purchased in 1834 in preparation
for<br>
 his marriage, situated on the boulevard between the Rue de la
Paix and<br>
 the Rue Louis-le-Grand. A speculator had built two houses
between the<br>
 boulevard and the street; and between these, with the gardens
and<br>
 courtyards to the front and back, there remained still standing
a<br>
 splendid wing, the remains of the magnificent mansion of the<br>
 Verneuils. The younger Hulot had purchased this fine property,
on the<br>
 strength of Mademoiselle Crevel's marriage-portion, for one
million<br>
 francs, when it was put up to auction, paying five hundred
thousand<br>
 down. He lived on the ground floor, expecting to pay the
remainder out<br>
 of letting the rest; but though it is safe to speculate in
house-<br>
 property in Paris, such investments are capricious or hang
fire,<br>
 depending on unforeseen circumstances.</p>

<p>As the Parisian lounger may have observed, the boulevard
between the<br>
 Rue de la Paix and the Rue Louis-le-Grand prospered but slowly;
it<br>
 took so long to furbish and beautify itself, that trade did not
set up<br>
 its display there till 1840--the gold of the money-changers,
the<br>
 fairy-work of fashion, and the luxurious splendor of
shop-fronts.</p>

<p>In spite of two hundred thousand francs given by Crevel to
his<br>
 daughter at the time when his vanity was flattered by this
marriage,<br>
 before the Baron had robbed him of Josepha; in spite of the
two<br>
 hundred thousand francs paid off by Victorin in the course of
seven<br>
 years, the property was still burdened with a debt of five
hundred<br>
 thousand francs, in consequence of Victorin's devotion to his
father.<br>
 Happily, a rise in rents and the advantages of the situation had
at<br>
 this time improved the value of the houses. The speculation
was<br>
 justifying itself after eight years' patience, during which the
lawyer<br>
 had strained every nerve to pay the interest and some trifling
amounts<br>
 of the capital borrowed.</p>

<p>The tradespeople were ready to offer good rents for the shops,
on<br>
 condition of being granted leases for eighteen years. The
dwelling<br>
 apartments rose in value by the shifting of the centre in Paris
life--<br>
 henceforth transferred to the region between the Bourse and
the<br>
 Madeleine, now the seat of the political power and financial
authority<br>
 in Paris. The money paid to him by the Minister, added to a
year's<br>
 rent in advance and the premiums paid by his tenants, would
finally<br>
 reduce the outstanding debt to two hundred thousand francs. The
two<br>
 houses, if entirely let, would bring in a hundred thousand
francs a<br>
 year. Within two years more, during which the Hulots could live
on his<br>
 salaries, added to by the Marshal's investments, Victorin would
be in<br>
 a splendid position.</p>

<p>This was manna from heaven. Victorin could give up the first
floor of<br>
 his own house to his mother, and the second to Hortense,
excepting two<br>
 rooms reserved for Lisbeth. With Cousin Betty as the
housekeeper, this<br>
 compound household could bear all these charges, and yet keep up
a<br>
 good appearance, as beseemed a pleader of note. The great stars
of the<br>
 law-courts were rapidly disappearing; and Victorin Hulot, gifted
with<br>
 a shrewd tongue and strict honesty, was listened to by the Bench
and<br>
 Councillors; he studied his cases thoroughly, and advanced
nothing<br>
 that he could not prove. He would not hold every brief that
offered;<br>
 in fact, he was a credit to the bar.</p>

<p>The Baroness' home in the Rue Plumet had become so odious to
her, that<br>
 she allowed herself to be taken to the Rue Louis-le-Grand. Thus,
by<br>
 her son's care, Adeline occupied a fine apartment; she was
spared all<br>
 the daily worries of life; for Lisbeth consented to begin
again,<br>
 working wonders of domestic economy, such as she had achieved
for<br>
 Madame Marneffe, seeing here a way of exerting her silent
vengeance on<br>
 those three noble lives, the object, each, of her hatred, which
was<br>
 kept growing by the overthrow of all her hopes.</p>

<p>Once a month she went to see Valerie, sent, indeed, by
Hortense, who<br>
 wanted news of Wenceslas, and by Celestine, who was seriously
uneasy<br>
 at the acknowledged and well-known connection between her father
and a<br>
 woman to whom her mother-in-law and sister-in-law owed their
ruin and<br>
 their sorrows. As may be supposed, Lisbeth took advantage of
this to<br>
 see Valerie as often as possible.</p>

<p>Thus, about twenty months passed by, during which the
Baroness<br>
 recovered her health, though her palsied trembling never left
her. She<br>
 made herself familiar with her duties, which afforded her a
noble<br>
 distraction from her sorrow and constant food for the divine
goodness<br>
 of her heart. She also regarded it as an opportunity for finding
her<br>
 husband in the course of one of those expeditions which took her
into<br>
 every part of Paris.</p>

<p><br>
 During this time, Vauvinet had been paid, and the pension of
six<br>
 thousand francs was almost redeemed. Victorin could maintain
his<br>
 mother as well as Hortense out of the ten thousand francs
interest on<br>
 the money left by Marshal Hulot in trust for them. Adeline's
salary<br>
 amounted to six thousand francs a year; and this, added to the
Baron's<br>
 pension when it was freed, would presently secure an income of
twelve<br>
 thousand francs a year to the mother and daughter.</p>

<p>Thus, the poor woman would have been almost happy but for
her<br>
 perpetual anxieties as to the Baron's fate; for she longed to
have him<br>
 with her to share the improved fortunes that smiled on the
family; and<br>
 but for the constant sight of her forsaken daughter; and but for
the<br>
 terrible thrusts constantly and <i>unconsciously</i> dealt her
by Lisbeth,<br>
 whose diabolical character had free course.</p>

<p>A scene which took place at the beginning of the month of
March 1843<br>
 will show the results of Lisbeth's latent and persistent hatred,
still<br>
 seconded, as she always was, by Madame Marneffe.</p>

<p>Two great events had occurred in the Marneffe household. In
the first<br>
 place, Valerie had given birth to a still-born child, whose
little<br>
 coffin had cost her two thousand francs a year. And then, as
to<br>
 Marneffe himself, eleven months since, this is the report given
by<br>
 Lisbeth to the Hulot family one day on her return from a visit
of<br>
 discovery at the hotel Marneffe.</p>

<p>"This morning," said she, "that dreadful Valerie sent for
Doctor<br>
 Bianchon to ask whether the medical men who had condemned her
husband<br>
 yesterday had made no mistake. Bianchon pronounced that to-night
at<br>
 the latest that horrible creature will depart to the torments
that<br>
 await him. Old Crevel and Madame Marneffe saw the doctor out;
and your<br>
 father, my dear Celestine, gave him five gold pieces for his
good<br>
 news.</p>

<p>"When he came back into the drawing-room, Crevel cut capers
like a<br>
 dancer; he embraced that woman, exclaiming, 'Then, at last, you
will<br>
 be Madame Crevel!'--And to me, when she had gone back to her
husband's<br>
 bedside, for he was at his last gasp, your noble father said to
me,<br>
 'With Valerie as my wife, I can become a peer of France! I shall
buy<br>
 an estate I have my eye on--Presles, which Madame de Serizy
wants to<br>
 sell. I shall be Crevel de Presles, member of the Common Council
of<br>
 Seine-et-Oise, and Deputy. I shall have a son! I shall be
everything I<br>
 have ever wished to be.'--'Heh!' said I, 'and what about
your<br>
 daughter?'--'Bah!' says he, 'she is only a woman! And she is
quite too<br>
 much of a Hulot. Valerie has a horror of them all.--My
son-in-law has<br>
 never chosen to come to this house; why has he given himself
such airs<br>
 as a Mentor, a Spartan, a Puritan, a philanthropist? Besides, I
have<br>
 squared accounts with my daughter; she has had all her
mother's<br>
 fortune, and two hundred thousand francs to that. So I am free
to act<br>
 as I please.--I shall judge of my son-in-law and Celestine by
their<br>
 conduct on my marriage; as they behave, so shall I. If they are
nice<br>
 to their stepmother, I will receive them. I am a man, after
all!'--In<br>
 short, all this rhodomontade! And an attitude like Napoleon on
the<br>
 column."</p>

<p>The ten months' widowhood insisted on by the law had now
elapsed some<br>
 few days since. The estate of Presles was purchased. Victorin
and<br>
 Celestine had that very morning sent Lisbeth to make inquiries
as to<br>
 the marriage of the fascinating widow to the Mayor of Paris, now
a<br>
 member of the Common Council of the Department of
Seine-et-Oise.</p>

<p>Celestine and Hortense, in whom the ties of affection had been
drawn<br>
 closer since they had lived under the same roof, were almost<br>
 inseparable. The Baroness, carried away by a sense of honesty
which<br>
 led her to exaggerate the duties of her place, devoted herself
to the<br>
 work of charity of which she was the agent; she was out almost
every<br>
 day from eleven till five. The sisters-in-law, united in their
cares<br>
 for the children whom they kept together, sat at home and
worked. They<br>
 had arrived at the intimacy which thinks aloud, and were a
touching<br>
 picture of two sisters, one cheerful and the other sad. The less
happy<br>
 of the two, handsome, lively, high-spirited, and clever, seemed
by her<br>
 manner to defy her painful situation; while the melancholy
Celestine,<br>
 sweet and calm, and as equable as reason itself, might have
been<br>
 supposed to have some secret grief. It was this
contradiction,<br>
 perhaps, that added to their warm friendship. Each supplied the
other<br>
 with what she lacked.</p>

<p>Seated in a little summer-house in the garden, which the
speculator's<br>
 trowel had spared by some fancy of the builder's, who believed
that he<br>
 was preserving these hundred feet square of earth for his
own<br>
 pleasure, they were admiring the first green shoots of the
lilac-<br>
 trees, a spring festival which can only be fully appreciated in
Paris<br>
 when the inhabitants have lived for six months oblivious of
what<br>
 vegetation means, among the cliffs of stone where the ocean
of<br>
 humanity tosses to and fro.</p>

<p>"Celestine," said Hortense to her sister-in-law, who had
complained<br>
 that in such fine weather her husband should be kept at the
Chamber,<br>
 "I think you do not fully appreciate your happiness. Victorin is
a<br>
 perfect angel, and you sometimes torment him."</p>

<p>"My dear, men like to be tormented! Certain ways of teasing
are a<br>
 proof of affection. If your poor mother had only been--I will
not say<br>
 exacting, but always prepared to be exacting, you would not have
had<br>
 so much to grieve over."</p>

<p>"Lisbeth is not come back. I shall have to sing the song
of<br>
 <i>Malbrouck</i>," said Hortense. "I do long for some news of
Wenceslas!--<br>
 What does he live on? He has not done a thing these two
years."</p>

<p>"Victorin saw him, he told me, with that horrible woman not
long ago;<br>
 and he fancied that she maintains him in idleness.--If you only
would,<br>
 dear soul, you might bring your husband back to you yet."</p>

<p>Hortense shook her head.</p>

<p>"Believe me," Celestine went on, "the position will ere long
be<br>
 intolerable. In the first instance, rage, despair, indignation,
gave<br>
 you strength. The awful disasters that have come upon us
since--two<br>
 deaths, ruin, and the disappearance of Baron Hulot--have
occupied your<br>
 mind and heart; but now you live in peace and silence, you will
find<br>
 it hard to bear the void in your life; and as you cannot, and
will<br>
 never leave the path of virtue, you will have to be reconciled
to<br>
 Wenceslas. Victorin, who loves you so much, is of that opinion.
There<br>
 is something stronger than one's feelings even, and that is
Nature!"</p>

<p>"But such a mean creature!" cried the proud Hortense. "He
cares for<br>
 that woman because she feeds him.--And has she paid his debts,
do you<br>
 suppose?--Good Heaven! I think of that man's position day and
night!<br>
 He is the father of my child, and he is degrading himself."</p>

<p>"But look at your mother, my dear," said Celestine.</p>

<p>Celestine was one of those women who, when you have given them
reasons<br>
 enough to convince a Breton peasant, still go back for the
hundredth<br>
 time to their original argument. The character of her face,
somewhat<br>
 flat, dull, and common, her light-brown hair in stiff, neat
bands, her<br>
 very complexion spoke of a sensible woman, devoid of charm, but
also<br>
 devoid of weakness.</p>

<p>"The Baroness would willingly go to join her husband in his
disgrace,<br>
 to comfort him and hide him in her heart from every eye,"
Celestine<br>
 went on. "Why, she has a room made ready upstairs for Monsieur
Hulot,<br>
 as if she expected to find him and bring him home from one day
to the<br>
 next."</p>

<p>"Oh yes, my mother is sublime!" replied Hortense. "She has
been so<br>
 every minute of every day for six-and-twenty years; but I am not
like<br>
 her, it is not my nature.--How can I help it? I am angry with
myself<br>
 sometimes; but you do not know, Celestine, what it would be to
make<br>
 terms with infamy."</p>

<p>"There is my father!" said Celestine placidly. "He has
certainly<br>
 started on the road that ruined yours. He is ten years younger
than<br>
 the Baron, to be sure, and was only a tradesman; but how can it
end?<br>
 This Madame Marneffe has made a slave of my father; he is her
dog; she<br>
 is mistress of his fortune and his opinions, and nothing can
open his<br>
 eyes. I tremble when I remember that their banns of marriage
are<br>
 already published!--My husband means to make a last attempt; he
thinks<br>
 it a duty to try to avenge society and the family, and bring
that<br>
 woman to account for all her crimes. Alas! my dear Hortense,
such<br>
 lofty souls as Victorin and hearts like ours come too late to
a<br>
 comprehension of the world and its ways!--This is a secret,
dear, and<br>
 I have told you because you are interested in it, but never by a
word<br>
 or a look betray it to Lisbeth, or your mother, or anybody,
for--"</p>

<p>"Here is Lisbeth!" said Hortense. "Well, cousin, and how is
the<br>
 Inferno of the Rue Barbet going on?"</p>

<p>"Badly for you, my children.--Your husband, my dear Hortense,
is more<br>
 crazy about that woman than ever, and she, I must own, is madly
in<br>
 love with him.--Your father, dear Celestine, is gloriously
blind.<br>
 That, to be sure, is nothing; I have had occasion to see it once
a<br>
 fortnight; really, I am lucky never to have had anything to do
with<br>
 men, they are besotted creatures.--Five days hence you, dear
child,<br>
 and Victorin will have lost your father's fortune."</p>

<p>"Then the banns are cried?" said Celestine.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Lisbeth, "and I have just been arguing your case.
I<br>
 pointed out to that monster, who is going the way of the other,
that<br>
 if he would only get you out of the difficulties you are in by
paying<br>
 off the mortgage on the house, you would show your gratitude
and<br>
 receive your stepmother--"</p>

<p>Hortense started in horror.</p>

<p>"Victorin will see about that," said Celestine coldly.</p>

<p>"But do you know what Monsieur le Maire's answer was?" said
Lisbeth.<br>
 " 'I mean to leave them where they are. Horses can only be
broken in<br>
 by lack of food, sleep, and sugar.'--Why, Baron Hulot was not so
bad<br>
 as Monsieur Crevel.</p>

<p>"So, my poor dears, you may say good-bye to the money. And
such a fine<br>
 fortune! Your father paid three million francs for the Presles
estate,<br>
 and he has thirty thousand francs a year in stocks! Oh!--he has
no<br>
 secrets from me. He talks of buying the Hotel de Navarreins, in
the<br>
 Rue du Bac. Madame Marneffe herself has forty thousand francs a
year.<br>
 --Ah!--here is our guardian angel, here comes your mother!"
she<br>
 exclaimed, hearing the rumble of wheels.</p>

<p>And presently the Baroness came down the garden steps and
joined the<br>
 party. At fifty-five, though crushed by so many troubles,
and<br>
 constantly trembling as if shivering with ague, Adeline, whose
face<br>
 was indeed pale and wrinkled, still had a fine figure, a
noble<br>
 outline, and natural dignity. Those who saw her said, "She must
have<br>
 been beautiful!" Worn with the grief of not knowing her
husband's<br>
 fate, of being unable to share with him this oasis in the heart
of<br>
 Paris, this peace and seclusion and the better fortune that
was<br>
 dawning on the family, her beauty was the beauty of a ruin. As
each<br>
 gleam of hope died out, each day of search proved vain, Adeline
sank<br>
 into fits of deep melancholy that drove her children to
despair.</p>

<p>The Baroness had gone out that morning with fresh hopes, and
was<br>
 anxiously expected. An official, who was under obligations to
Hulot,<br>
 to whom he owed his position and advancement, declared that he
had<br>
 seen the Baron in a box at the Ambigu-Comique theatre with a
woman of<br>
 extraordinary beauty. So Adeline had gone to call on the
Baron<br>
 Verneuil. This important personage, while asserting that he
had<br>
 positively seen his old patron, and that his behaviour to the
woman<br>
 indicated an illicit establishment, told Madame Hulot that to
avoid<br>
 meeting him the Baron had left long before the end of the
play.</p>

<p>"He looked like a man at home with the damsel, but his dress
betrayed<br>
 some lack of means," said he in conclusion.</p>

<p>"Well?" said the three women as the Baroness came towards
them.</p>

<p>"Well, Monsieur Hulot is in Paris; and to me," said Adeline,
"it is a<br>
 gleam of happiness only to know that he is within reach of
us."</p>

<p>"But he does not seem to have mended his ways," Lisbeth
remarked when<br>
 Adeline had finished her report of her visit to Baron Verneuil.
"He<br>
 has taken up some little work-girl. But where can he get the
money<br>
 from? I could bet that he begs of his former
mistresses--Mademoiselle<br>
 Jenny Cadine or Josepha."</p>

<p>The Baroness trembled more severely than ever; every nerve
quivered;<br>
 she wiped away the tears that rose to her eyes and looked
mournfully<br>
 up to heaven.</p>

<p>"I cannot think that a Grand Commander of the Legion of Honor
will<br>
 have fallen so low," said she.</p>

<p>"For his pleasure what would he not do?" said Lisbeth. "He
robbed the<br>
 State, he will rob private persons, commit murder--who
knows?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Lisbeth!" cried the Baroness, "keep such thoughts to
yourself."</p>

<p>At this moment Louise came up to the family group, now
increased by<br>
 the arrival of the two Hulot children and little Wenceslas to
see if<br>
 their grandmother's pockets did not contain some sweetmeats.</p>

<p>"What is it, Louise?" asked one and another.</p>

<p>"A man who wants to see Mademoiselle Fischer."</p>

<p>"Who is the man?" asked Lisbeth.</p>

<p>"He is in rags, mademoiselle, and covered with flue like a
mattress-<br>
 picker; his nose is red, and he smells of brandy.--He is one of
those<br>
 men who work half of the week at most."</p>

<p>This uninviting picture had the effect of making Lisbeth hurry
into<br>
 the courtyard of the house in the Rue Louis-le-Grand, where she
found<br>
 a man smoking a pipe colored in a style that showed him an
artist in<br>
 tobacco.</p>

<p>"Why have you come here, Pere Chardin?" she asked. "It is
understood<br>
 that you go, on the first Saturday in every month, to the gate
of the<br>
 Hotel Marneffe, Rue Barbet-de-Jouy. I have just come back
after<br>
 waiting there for five hours, and you did not come."</p>

<p>"I did go there, good and charitable lady!" replied the
mattress-<br>
 picker. "But there was a game at pool going on at the Cafe
des<br>
 Savants, Rue du Cerf-Volant, and every man has his fancy. Now,
mine is<br>
 billiards. If it wasn't for billiards, I might be eating off
silver<br>
 plate. For, I tell you this," and he fumbled for a scrap of
paper in<br>
 his ragged trousers pocket, "it is billiards that leads on to a
dram<br>
 and plum-brandy.--It is ruinous, like all fine things, in the
things<br>
 it leads to. I know your orders, but the old 'un is in such a
quandary<br>
 that I came on to forbidden grounds.--If the hair was all hair,
we<br>
 might sleep sound on it; but it is mixed. God is not for all, as
the<br>
 saying goes. He has His favorites--well, He has the right. Now,
here<br>
 is the writing of your estimable relative and my very good
friend--his<br>
 political opinion."</p>

<p>Chardin attempted to trace some zigzag lines in the air with
the<br>
 forefinger of his right hand.</p>

<p>Lisbeth, not listening to him, read these few words:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"DEAR COUSIN,--Be my Providence; give me three hundred francs
this<br>
 day.</p>

<p>"HECTOR."</p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
 "What does he want so much money for?"</p>

<p>"The lan'lord!" said Chardin, still trying to sketch
arabesques. "And<br>
 then my son, you see, has come back from Algiers through Spain
and<br>
 Bayonee, and, and--he has <i>found</i> nothing--against his
rule, for a<br>
 sharp cove is my son, saving your presence. How can he help it,
he is<br>
 in want of food; but he will repay all we lend him, for he is
going to<br>
 get up a company. He has ideas, he has, that will carry
him--"</p>

<p><br>
 "To the police court," Lisbeth put in. "He murdered my uncle; I
shall<br>
 not forget that."</p>

<p>"He--why, he could not bleed a chicken, honorable lady."</p>

<p>"Here are the three hundred francs," said Lisbeth, taking
fifteen gold<br>
 pieces out of her purse. "Now, go, and never come here
again."</p>

<p>She saw the father of the Oran storekeeper off the premises,
and<br>
 pointed out the drunken old creature to the porter.</p>

<p>"At any time when that man comes here, if by chance he should
come<br>
 again, do not let him in. If he should ask whether Monsieur
Hulot<br>
 junior or Madame la Baronne Hulot lives here, tell him you know
of no<br>
 such persons."</p>

<p>"Very good, mademoiselle."</p>

<p>"Your place depends on it if you make any mistake, even
without<br>
 intending it," said Lisbeth, in the woman's ear.--"Cousin," she
went<br>
 on to Victorin, who just now came in, "a great misfortune is
hanging<br>
 over your head."</p>

<p>"What is that?" said Victorin.</p>

<p>"Within a few days Madame Marneffe will be your wife's
stepmother."</p>

<p>"That remains to be seen," replied Victorin.</p>

<p>For six months past Lisbeth had very regularly paid a little
allowance<br>
 to Baron Hulot, her former protector, whom she now protected;
she knew<br>
 the secret of his dwelling-place, and relished Adeline's tears,
saying<br>
 to her, as we have seen, when she saw her cheerful and hopeful,
"You<br>
 may expect to find my poor cousin's name in the papers some day
under<br>
 the heading 'Police Report.' "</p>

<p>But in this, as on a former occasion, she let her vengeance
carry her<br>
 too far. She had aroused the prudent suspicions of Victorin. He
had<br>
 resolved to be rid of this Damocles' sword so constantly
flourished<br>
 over them by Lisbeth, and of the female demon to whom his mother
and<br>
 the family owed so many woes. The Prince de Wissembourg, knowing
all<br>
 about Madame Marneffe's conduct, approved of the young lawyer's
secret<br>
 project; he had promised him, as a President of the Council
can<br>
 promise, the secret assistance of the police, to enlighten
Crevel and<br>
 rescue a fine fortune from the clutches of the diabolical
courtesan,<br>
 whom he could not forgive either for causing the death of
Marshal<br>
 Hulot or for the Baron's utter ruin.</p>

<p>The words spoken by Lisbeth, "He begs of his former
mistresses,"<br>
 haunted the Baroness all night. Like sick men given over by
the<br>
 physicians, who have recourse to quacks, like men who have
fallen into<br>
 the lowest Dantesque circle of despair, or drowning creatures
who<br>
 mistake a floating stick for a hawser, she ended by believing in
the<br>
 baseness of which the mere idea had horrified her; and it
occurred to<br>
 her that she might apply for help to one of those terrible
women.</p>

<p>Next morning, without consulting her children or saying a word
to<br>
 anybody, she went to see Mademoiselle Josepha Mirah, prima donna
of<br>
 the Royal Academy of Music, to find or to lose the hope that
had<br>
 gleamed before her like a will-o'-the-wisp. At midday, the
great<br>
 singer's waiting-maid brought her in the card of the Baronne
Hulot,<br>
 saying that this person was waiting at the door, having asked
whether<br>
 Mademoiselle could receive her.</p>

<p>"Are the rooms done?"</p>

<p>"Yes, mademoiselle."</p>

<p>"And the flowers fresh?"</p>

<p>"Yes, mademoiselle."</p>

<p>"Just tell Jean to look round and see that everything is as it
should<br>
 be before showing the lady in, and treat her with the
greatest<br>
 respect. Go, and come back to dress me--I must look my very
best."</p>

<p>She went to study herself in the long glass.</p>

<p>"Now, to put our best foot foremost!" said she to herself.
"Vice under<br>
 arms to meet virtue!--Poor woman, what can she want of me? I
cannot<br>
 bear to see.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"The noble victim of outrageous fortune!"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And she sang through the famous aria as the maid came in
again.</p>

<p><br>
 "Madame," said the girl, "the lady has a nervous
trembling--"</p>

<p>"Offer her some orange-water, some rum, some broth--"</p>

<p>"I did, mademoiselle; but she declines everything, and says it
is an<br>
 infirmity, a nervous complaint--"</p>

<p>"Where is she?"</p>

<p>"In the big drawing-room."</p>

<p>"Well, make haste, child. Give me my smartest slippers, the
dressing-<br>
 gown embroidered by Bijou, and no end of lace frills. Do my hair
in a<br>
 way to astonish a woman.--This woman plays a part against mine;
and<br>
 tell the lady--for she is a real, great lady, my girl, nay,
more, she<br>
 is what you will never be, a woman whose prayers can rescue
souls from<br>
 your purgatory--tell her I was in bed, as I was playing last
night,<br>
 and that I am just getting up."</p>

<p>The Baroness, shown into Josepha's handsome drawing-room, did
not note<br>
 how long she was kept waiting there, though it was a long half
hour.<br>
 This room, entirely redecorated even since Josepha had had the
house,<br>
 was hung with silk in purple and gold color. The luxury which
fine<br>
 gentlemen were wont to lavish on their <i>petites maisons</i>,
the scenes<br>
 of their profligacy, of which the remains still bear witness to
the<br>
 follies from which they were so aptly named, was displayed
to<br>
 perfection, thanks to modern inventiveness, in the four rooms
opening<br>
 into each other, where the warm temperature was maintained by a
system<br>
 of hot-air pipes with invisible openings.</p>

<p>The Baroness, quite bewildered, examined each work of art with
the<br>
 greatest amazement. Here she found fortunes accounted for that
melt in<br>
 the crucible under which pleasure and vanity feed the
devouring<br>
 flames. This woman, who for twenty-six years had lived among the
dead<br>
 relics of imperial magnificence, whose eyes were accustomed to
carpets<br>
 patterned with faded flowers, rubbed gilding, silks as forlorn
as her<br>
 heart, half understood the powerful fascinations of vice as
she<br>
 studied its results. It was impossible not to wish to possess
these<br>
 beautiful things, these admirable works of art, the creation of
the<br>
 unknown talent which abounds in Paris in our day and
produces<br>
 treasures for all Europe. Each thing had the novel charm of
unique<br>
 perfection. The models being destroyed, every vase, every
figure,<br>
 every piece of sculpture was the original. This is the crowning
grace<br>
 of modern luxury. To own the thing which is not vulgarized by
the two<br>
 thousand wealthy citizens whose notion of luxury is the lavish
display<br>
 of the splendors that shops can supply, is the stamp of true
luxury--<br>
 the luxury of the fine gentlemen of the day, the shooting stars
of the<br>
 Paris firmament.</p>

<p>As she examined the flower-stands, filled with the choicest
exotic<br>
 plants, mounted in chased brass and inlaid in the style of
Boulle, the<br>
 Baroness was scared by the idea of the wealth in this apartment.
And<br>
 this impression naturally shed a glamour over the person round
whom<br>
 all this profusion was heaped. Adeline imagined that Josepha
Mirah--<br>
 whose portrait by Joseph Bridau was the glory of the adjoining
boudoir<br>
 --must be a singer of genius, a Malibran, and she expected to
see a<br>
 real star. She was sorry she had come. But she had been prompted
by a<br>
 strong and so natural a feeling, by such purely
disinterested<br>
 devotion, that she collected all her courage for the
interview.<br>
 Besides, she was about to satisfy her urgent curiosity, to see
for<br>
 herself what was the charm of this kind of women, that they
could<br>
 extract so much gold from the miserly ore of Paris mud.</p>

<p>The Baroness looked at herself to see if she were not a blot
on all<br>
 this splendor; but she was well dressed in her velvet gown, with
a<br>
 little cape trimmed with beautiful lace, and her velvet bonnet
of the<br>
 same shade was becoming. Seeing herself still as imposing as
any<br>
 queen, always a queen even in her fall, she reflected that the
dignity<br>
 of sorrow was a match for the dignity of talent.</p>

<p>At last, after much opening and shutting of doors, she saw
Josepha.<br>
 The singer bore a strong resemblance to Allori's <i>Judith</i>,
which<br>
 dwells in the memory of all who have ever seen it in the Pitti
palace,<br>
 near the door of one of the great rooms. She had the same
haughty<br>
 mien, the same fine features, black hair simply knotted, and a
yellow<br>
 wrapper with little embroidered flowers, exactly like the
brocade worn<br>
 by the immortal homicide conceived of by Bronzino's nephew.</p>

<p>"Madame la Baronne, I am quite overwhelmed by the honor you do
me in<br>
 coming here," said the singer, resolved to play her part as a
great<br>
 lady with a grace.</p>

<p>She pushed forward an easy-chair for the Baroness and seated
herself<br>
 on a stool. She discerned the faded beauty of the woman before
her,<br>
 and was filled with pity as she saw her shaken by the nervous
palsy<br>
 that, on the least excitement, became convulsive. She could read
at a<br>
 glance the saintly life described to her of old by Hulot and
Crevel;<br>
 and she not only ceased to think of a contest with her, she
humiliated<br>
 herself before a superiority she appreciated. The great artist
could<br>
 admire what the courtesan laughed to scorn.</p>

<p>"Mademoiselle, despair brought me here. It reduces us to any
means--"</p>

<p>A look in Josepha's face made the Baroness feel that she had
wounded<br>
 the woman from whom she hoped for so much, and she looked at
her. Her<br>
 beseeching eyes extinguished the flash in Josepha's; the
singer<br>
 smiled. It was a wordless dialogue of pathetic eloquence.</p>

<p>"It is now two years and a half since Monsieur Hulot left his
family,<br>
 and I do not know where to find him, though I know that he lives
in<br>
 Paris," said the Baroness with emotion. "A dream suggested to me
the<br>
 idea--an absurd one perhaps--that you may have interested
yourself in<br>
 Monsieur Hulot. If you could enable me to see him--oh!
mademoiselle, I<br>
 would pray Heaven for you every day as long as I live in this
world--"</p>

<p>Two large tears in the singer's eyes told what her reply would
be.</p>

<p>"Madame," said she, "I have done you an injury without knowing
you;<br>
 but, now that I have the happiness of seeing in you the most
perfect<br>
 virtue on earth, believe me I am sensible of the extent of my
fault; I<br>
 repent sincerely, and believe me, I will do all in my power to
remedy<br>
 it!"</p>

<p>She took Madame Hulot's hand and before the lady could do
anything to<br>
 hinder her, she kissed it respectfully, even humbling herself to
bend<br>
 one knee. Then she rose, as proud as when she stood on the stage
in<br>
 the part of <i>Mathilde</i>, and rang the bell.</p>

<p>"Go on horseback," said she to the man-servant, "and kill the
horse if<br>
 you must, to find little Bijou, Rue Saint-Maur-du-Temple, and
bring<br>
 her here. Put her into a coach and pay the coachman to come at
a<br>
 gallop. Do not lose a moment--or you lose your place.</p>

<p>"Madame," she went on, coming back to the Baroness, and
speaking to<br>
 her in respectful tones, "you must forgive me. As soon as the
Duc<br>
 d'Herouville became my protector, I dismissed the Baron, having
heard<br>
 that he was ruining his family for me. What more could I do? In
an<br>
 actress' career a protector is indispensable from the first day
of her<br>
 appearance on the boards. Our salaries do not pay half our
expenses;<br>
 we must have a temporary husband. I did not value Monsieur
Hulot, who<br>
 took me away from a rich man, a conceited idiot. Old Crevel
would<br>
 undoubtedly have married me--"</p>

<p>"So he told me," said the Baroness, interrupting her.</p>

<p>"Well, then, you see, madame, I might at this day have been an
honest<br>
 woman, with only one legitimate husband!"</p>

<p>"You have many excuses, mademoiselle," said Adeline, "and God
will<br>
 take them into account. But, for my part, far from reproaching
you, I<br>
 came, on the contrary, to make myself your debtor in
gratitude--"</p>

<p>"Madame, for nearly three years I have provided for Monsieur
le<br>
 Baron's necessities--"</p>

<p>"You?" interrupted the Baroness, with tears in her eyes. "Oh,
what can<br>
 I do for you? I can only pray--"</p>

<p>"I and Monsieur le Duc d'Herouville," the singer said, "a
noble soul,<br>
 a true gentleman--" and Josepha related the settling and
<i>marriage</i> of<br>
 Monsieur Thoul.</p>

<p>"And so, thanks to you, mademoiselle, the Baron has wanted
nothing?"</p>

<p>"We have done our best to that end, madame."</p>

<p>"And where is he now?"</p>

<p>"About six months ago, Monsieur le Duc told me that the Baron,
known<br>
 to the notary by the name of Thoul, had drawn all the eight
thousand<br>
 francs that were to have been paid to him in fixed sums once
a<br>
 quarter," replied Josepha. "We have heard no more of the
Baron,<br>
 neither I nor Monsieur d'Herouville. Our lives are so full, we
artists<br>
 are so busy, that I really have not time to run after old Thoul.
As it<br>
 happens, for the last six months, Bijou, who works for
me--his--what<br>
 shall I say--?"</p>

<p>"His mistress," said Madame Hulot.</p>

<p>"His mistress," repeated Josepha, "has not been here.
Mademoiselle<br>
 Olympe Bijou is perhaps divorced. Divorce is common in the
thirteenth<br>
 arrondissement."</p>

<p>Josepha rose, and foraging among the rare plants in her
stands, made a<br>
 charming bouquet for Madame Hulot, whose expectations, it may be
said,<br>
 were by no means fulfilled. Like those worthy fold, who take men
of<br>
 genius to be a sort of monsters, eating, drinking, walking,
and<br>
 speaking unlike other people, the Baroness had hoped to see
Josepha<br>
 the opera singer, the witch, the amorous and amusing courtesan;
she<br>
 saw a calm and well-mannered woman, with the dignity of talent,
the<br>
 simplicity of an actress who knows herself to be at night a
queen, and<br>
 also, better than all, a woman of the town whose eyes, attitude,
and<br>
 demeanor paid full and ungrudging homage to the virtuous wife,
the<br>
 <i>Mater dolorosa</i> of the sacred hymn, and who was crowning
her sorrows<br>
 with flowers, as the Madonna is crowned in Italy.</p>

<p>"Madame," said the man-servant, reappearing at the end of half
an<br>
 hour, "Madame Bijou is on her way, but you are not to expect
little<br>
 Olympe. Your needle-woman, madame, is settled in life; she
is<br>
 married--"</p>

<p>"More or less?" said Josepha.</p>

<p>"No, madame, really married. She is at the head of a very
fine<br>
 business; she has married the owner of a large and fashionable
shop,<br>
 on which they have spent millions of francs, on the Boulevard
des<br>
 Italiens; and she has left the embroidery business to her sister
and<br>
 mother. She is Madame Grenouville. The fat tradesman--"</p>

<p>"A Crevel?"</p>

<p>"Yes, madame," said the man. "Well, he has settled thirty
thousand<br>
 francs a year on Mademoiselle Bijou by the marriage articles.
And her<br>
 elder sister, they say, is going to be married to a rich
butcher."</p>

<p>"Your business looks rather hopeless, I am afraid," said
Josepha to<br>
 the Baroness. "Monsieur le Baron is no longer where I lodged
him."</p>

<p>Ten minutes later Madame Bijou was announced. Josepha very
prudently<br>
 placed the Baroness in the boudoir, and drew the curtain over
the<br>
 door.</p>

<p>"You would scare her," said she to Madame Hulot. "She would
let<br>
 nothing out if she suspected that you were interested in the<br>
 information. Leave me to catechise her. Hide there, and you will
hear<br>
 everything. It is a scene that is played quite as often in real
life<br>
 as on the stage--"</p>

<p>"Well, Mother Bijou," she said to an old woman dressed in
tartan<br>
 stuff, and who looked like a porter's wife in her Sunday best,
"so you<br>
 are all very happy? Your daughter is in luck."</p>

<p>"Oh, happy? As for that!--My daughter gives us a hundred
francs a<br>
 month, while she rides in a carriage and eats off silver
plate--she is<br>
 a millionary, is my daughter! Olympe might have lifted me above
labor.<br>
 To have to work at my age? Is that being good to me?"</p>

<p>"She ought not to be ungrateful, for she owes her beauty to
you,"<br>
 replied Josepha; "but why did she not come to see me? It was I
who<br>
 placed her in ease by settling her with my uncle."</p>

<p>"Yes, madame, with old Monsieur Thoul, but he is very old
and<br>
 broken--"</p>

<p>"But what have you done with him? Is he with you? She was very
foolish<br>
 to leave him; he is worth millions now."</p>

<p>"Heaven above us!" cried the mother. "What did I tell her when
she<br>
 behaved so badly to him, and he as mild as milk, poor old
fellow? Oh!<br>
 didn't she just give it him hot?--Olympe was perverted,
madame?"</p>

<p>"But how?"</p>

<p>"She got to know a <i>claqueur</i>, madame, saving your
presence, a man<br>
 paid to clap, you know, the grand nephew of an old
mattress-picker of<br>
 the Faubourg Saint-Marceau. This good-for-naught, as all your
good-<br>
 looking fellows are, paid to make a piece go, is the cock of the
walk<br>
 out on the Boulevard du Temple, where he works up the new plays,
and<br>
 takes care that the actresses get a reception, as he calls it.
First,<br>
 he has a good breakfast in the morning; then, before the play,
he<br>
 dines, to be 'up to the mark,' as he says; in short, he is a
born<br>
 lover of billiards and drams. 'But that is not following a
trade,' as<br>
 I said to Olympe."</p>

<p>"It is a trade men follow, unfortunately," said Josepha.</p>

<p>"Well, the rascal turned Olympe's head, and he, madame, did
not keep<br>
 good company--when I tell you he was very near being nabbed by
the<br>
 police in a tavern where thieves meet. 'Wever, Monsieur
Braulard, the<br>
 leader of the claque, got him out of that. He wears gold
earrings, and<br>
 he lives by doing nothing, hanging on to women, who are fools
about<br>
 these good-looking scamps. He spent all the money Monsieur Thoul
used<br>
 to give the child.</p>

<p>"Then the business was going to grief; what embroidery brought
in went<br>
 out across the billiard table. 'Wever, the young fellow had a
pretty<br>
 sister, madame, who, like her brother, lived by hook and by
crook, and<br>
 no better than she should be neither, over in the students'
quarter."</p>

<p>"One of the sluts at the Chaumiere," said Josepha.</p>

<p>"So, madame," said the old woman. "So Idamore, his name is
Idamore,<br>
 leastways that is what he calls himself, for his real name is
Chardin<br>
 --Idamore fancied that your uncle had a deal more money than he
owned<br>
 to, and he managed to send his sister Elodie--and that was a
stage<br>
 name he gave her--to send her to be a workwoman at our place,
without<br>
 my daughter's knowing who she was; and, gracious goodness! but
that<br>
 girl turned the whole place topsy-turvy; she got all those poor
girls<br>
 into mischief--impossible to whitewash them, saving your
presence----</p>

<p>"And she was so sharp, she won over poor old Thoul, and took
him away,<br>
 and we don't know where, and left us in a pretty fix, with a lot
of<br>
 bills coming in. To this day as ever is we have not been able
to<br>
 settle up; but my daughter, who knows all about such things,
keeps an<br>
 eye on them as they fall due.--Then, when Idamore saw he had got
hold<br>
 of the old man, through his sister, you understand, he threw
over my<br>
 daughter, and now he has got hold of a little actress at the<br>
 <i>Funambules</i>.--And that was how my daughter came to get
married, as<br>
 you will see--"</p>

<p><br>
 "But you must know where the mattress-picker lives?" said
Josepha.</p>

<p>"What! old Chardin? As if he lived anywhere at all!--He is
drunk by<br>
 six in the morning; he makes a mattress once a month; he hangs
about<br>
 the wineshops all day; he plays at pools--"</p>

<p>"He plays at pools?" said Josepha.</p>

<p>"You do not understand, madame, pools of billiards, I mean,
and he<br>
 wins three or four a day, and then he drinks."</p>

<p>"Water out of the pools, I suppose?" said Josepha. "But if
Idamore<br>
 haunts the Boulevard, by inquiring through my friend Vraulard,
we<br>
 could find him."</p>

<p>"I don't know, madame; all this was six months ago. Idamore
was one of<br>
 the sort who are bound to find their way into the police courts,
and<br>
 from that to Melun--and the--who knows--?"</p>

<p>"To the prison yard!" said Josepha.</p>

<p>"Well, madame, you know everything," said the old woman,
smiling.<br>
 "Well, if my girl had never known that scamp, she would now
be--Still,<br>
 she was in luck, all the same, you will say, for Monsieur
Grenouville<br>
 fell so much in love with her that he married her--"</p>

<p>"And what brought that about?"</p>

<p>"Olympe was desperate, madame. When she found herself left in
the<br>
 lurch for that little actress--and she took a rod out of pickle
for<br>
 her, I can tell you; my word, but she gave her a dressing!--and
when<br>
 she had lost poor old Thoul, who worshiped her, she would have
nothing<br>
 more to say to the men. 'Wever, Monsieur Grenouville, who had
been<br>
 dealing largely with us--to the tune of two hundred embroidered
China-<br>
 crape shawls every quarter--he wanted to console her; but
whether or<br>
 no, she would not listen to anything without the mayor and the
priest.<br>
 'I mean to be respectable,' said she, 'or perish!' and she stuck
to<br>
 it. Monsieur Grenouville consented to marry her, on condition of
her<br>
 giving us all up, and we agreed--"</p>

<p>"For a handsome consideration?" said Josepha, with her
usual<br>
 perspicacity.</p>

<p>"Yes, madame, ten thousand francs, and an allowance to my
father, who<br>
 is past work."</p>

<p>"I begged your daughter to make old Thoul happy, and she has
thrown me<br>
 over. That is not fair. I will take no interest in any one for
the<br>
 future! That is what comes of trying to do good! Benevolence
certainly<br>
 does not answer as a speculation!--Olympe ought, at least, to
have<br>
 given me notice of this jobbing. Now, if you find the old man
Thoul<br>
 within a fortnight, I will give you a thousand francs."</p>

<p>"It will be a hard task, my good lady; still, there are a good
many<br>
 five-franc pieces in a thousand francs, and I will try to earn
your<br>
 money."</p>

<p>"Good-morning, then, Madame Bijou."</p>

<p>On going into the boudoir, the singer found that Madame Hulot
had<br>
 fainted; but in spite of having lost consciousness, her
nervous<br>
 trembling kept her still perpetually shaking, as the pieces of a
snake<br>
 that has been cut up still wriggle and move. Strong salts, cold
water,<br>
 and all the ordinary remedies were applied to recall the
Baroness to<br>
 her senses, or rather, to the apprehension of her sorrows.</p>

<p>"Ah! mademoiselle, how far has he fallen!" cried she,
recognizing<br>
 Josepha, and finding that she was alone with her.</p>

<p>"Take heart, madame," replied the actress, who had seated
herself on a<br>
 cushion at Adeline's feet, and was kissing her hands. "We shall
find<br>
 him; and if he is in the mire, well, he must wash himself.
Believe me,<br>
 with people of good breeding it is a matter of clothes.--Allow
me to<br>
 make up for you the harm I have done you, for I see how much you
are<br>
 attached to your husband, in spite of his misconduct--or you
should<br>
 not have come here.--Well, you see, the poor man is so fond of
women.<br>
 If you had had a little of our dash, you would have kept him
from<br>
 running about the world; for you would have been what we can
never be<br>
 --all the women man wants.</p>

<p>"The State ought to subsidize a school of manners for honest
women!<br>
 But governments are so prudish! Still, they are guided by men,
whom we<br>
 privately guide. My word, I pity nations!</p>

<p>"But the matter in question is how you can be helped, and not
to laugh<br>
 at the world.--Well, madame, be easy, go home again, and do not
worry.<br>
 I will bring your Hector back to you as he was as a man of
thirty."</p>

<p>"Ah, mademoiselle, let us go to see that Madame Grenouville,"
said the<br>
 Baroness. "She surely knows something! Perhaps I may see the
Baron<br>
 this very day, and be able to snatch him at once from poverty
and<br>
 disgrace."</p>

<p>"Madame, I will show you the deep gratitude I feel towards you
by not<br>
 displaying the stage-singer Josepha, the Duc d'Herouville's
mistress,<br>
 in the company of the noblest, saintliest image of virtue. I
respect<br>
 you too much to be seen by your side. This is not acted
humility; it<br>
 is sincere homage. You make me sorry, madame, that I cannot
tread in<br>
 your footsteps, in spite of the thorns that tear your feet and
hands.<br>
 --But it cannot be helped! I am one with art, as you are one
with<br>
 virtue."</p>

<p>"Poor child!" said the Baroness, moved amid her own sorrows by
a<br>
 strange sense of compassionate sympathy; "I will pray to God for
you;<br>
 for you are the victim of society, which must have theatres.
When you<br>
 are old, repent--you will be heard if God vouchsafes to hear
the<br>
 prayers of a--"</p>

<p>"Of a martyr, madame," Josepha put in, and she respectfully
kissed the<br>
 Baroness' skirt.</p>

<p>But Adeline took the actress' hand, and drawing her towards
her,<br>
 kissed her on the forehead. Coloring with pleasure Josepha saw
the<br>
 Baroness into the hackney coach with the humblest
politeness.</p>

<p>"It must be some visiting Lady of Charity," said the
man-servant to<br>
 the maid, "for she does not do so much for any one, not even for
her<br>
 dear friend Madame Jenny Cadine."</p>

<p>"Wait a few days," said she, "and you will see him, madame, or
I<br>
 renounce the God of my fathers--and that from a Jewess, you
know, is a<br>
 promise of success."</p>

<p>At the very time when Madame Hulot was calling on Josepha,
Victorin,<br>
 in his study, was receiving an old woman of about seventy-five,
who,<br>
 to gain admission to the lawyer, had used the terrible name of
the<br>
 head of the detective force. The man in waiting announced:</p>

<p>"Madame de Saint-Esteve."</p>

<p>"I have assumed one of my business names," said she, taking a
seat.</p>

<p>Victorin felt a sort of internal chill at the sight of this
dreadful<br>
 old woman. Though handsomely dressed, she was terrible to look
upon,<br>
 for her flat, colorless, strongly-marked face, furrowed with
wrinkles,<br>
 expressed a sort of cold malignity. Marat, as a woman of that
age,<br>
 might have been like this creature, a living embodiment of the
Reign<br>
 of Terror.</p>

<p>This sinister old woman's small, pale eyes twinkled with a
tiger's<br>
 bloodthirsty greed. Her broad, flat nose, with nostrils expanded
into<br>
 oval cavities, breathed the fires of hell, and resembled the
beak of<br>
 some evil bird of prey. The spirit of intrigue lurked behind her
low,<br>
 cruel brow. Long hairs had grown from her wrinkled chin,
betraying the<br>
 masculine character of her schemes. Any one seeing that woman's
face<br>
 would have said that artists had failed in their conceptions
of<br>
 Mephistopheles.</p>

<p>"My dear sir," she began, with a patronizing air, "I have long
since<br>
 given up active business of any kind. What I have come to you to
do, I<br>
 have undertaken, for the sake of my dear nephew, whom I love
more than<br>
 I could love a son of my own.--Now, the Head of the Police--to
whom<br>
 the President of the Council said a few words in his ear as
regards<br>
 yourself, in talking to Monsieur Chapuzot--thinks as the police
ought<br>
 not to appear in a matter of this description, you understand.
They<br>
 gave my nephew a free hand, but my nephew will have nothing to
say to<br>
 it, except as before the Council; he will not be seen in
it."</p>

<p>"Then your nephew is--"</p>

<p>"You have hit it, and I am rather proud of him," said she,<br>
 interrupting the lawyer, "for he is my pupil, and he soon could
teach<br>
 his teacher.--We have considered this case, and have come to our
own<br>
 conclusions. Will you hand over thirty thousand francs to have
the<br>
 whole thing taken off your hands? I will make a clean sweep of
all,<br>
 and you need not pay till the job is done."</p>

<p>"Do you know the persons concerned?"</p>

<p>"No, my dear sir; I look for information from you. What we are
told<br>
 is, that a certain old idiot has fallen into the clutches of a
widow.<br>
 This widow, of nine-and-twenty, has played her cards so well,
that she<br>
 has forty thousand francs a year, of which she has robbed two
fathers<br>
 of families. She is now about to swallow down eighty thousand
francs a<br>
 year by marrying an old boy of sixty-one. She will thus ruin
a<br>
 respectable family, and hand over this vast fortune to the child
of<br>
 some lover by getting rid at once of the old husband.--That is
the<br>
 case as stated."</p>

<p>"Quite correct," said Victorin. "My father-in-law, Monsieur
Crevel--"</p>

<p>"Formerly a perfumer, a mayor--yes, I live in his district
under the<br>
 name of Ma'ame Nourrisson," said the woman.</p>

<p>"The other person is Madame Marneffe."</p>

<p>"I do not know," said Madame de Saint-Esteve. "But within
three days I<br>
 will be in a position to count her shifts."</p>

<p>"Can you hinder the marriage?" asked Victorin.</p>

<p>"How far have they got?"</p>

<p>"To the second time of asking."</p>

<p>"We must carry off the woman.--To-day is Sunday--there are but
three<br>
 days, for they will be married on Wednesday, no doubt; it is<br>
 impossible.--But she may be killed--"</p>

<p>Victorin Hulot started with an honest man's horror at hearing
these<br>
 five words uttered in cold blood.</p>

<p>"Murder?" said he. "And how could you do it?"</p>

<p>"For forty years, now, monsieur, we have played the part of
fate,"<br>
 replied she, with terrible pride, "and do just what we will in
Paris.<br>
 More than one family--even in the Faubourg Saint-Germain--has
told me<br>
 all its secrets, I can tell you. I have made and spoiled many a
match,<br>
 I have destroyed many a will and saved many a man's honor. I
have in<br>
 there," and she tapped her forehead, "a store of secrets which
are<br>
 worth thirty-six thousand francs a year to me; and you--you will
be<br>
 one of my lambs, hoh! Could such a woman as I am be what I am if
she<br>
 revealed her ways and means? I act.</p>

<p>"Whatever I may do, sir, will be the result of an accident;
you need<br>
 feel no remorse. You will be like a man cured by a clairvoyant;
by the<br>
 end of a month, it seems all the work of Nature."</p>

<p>Victorin broke out in a cold sweat. The sight of an
executioner would<br>
 have shocked him less than this prolix and pretentious Sister of
the<br>
 Hulks. As he looked at her purple-red gown, she seemed to him
dyed in<br>
 blood.</p>

<p>"Madame, I do not accept the help of your experience and skill
if<br>
 success is to cost anybody's life, or the least criminal act is
to<br>
 come of it."</p>

<p>"You are a great baby, monsieur," replied the woman; "you wish
to<br>
 remain blameless in your own eyes, while you want your enemy to
be<br>
 overthrown."</p>

<p>Victorin shook his head in denial.</p>

<p>"Yes," she went on, "you want this Madame Marneffe to drop the
prey<br>
 she has between her teeth. But how do you expect to make a tiger
drop<br>
 his piece of beef? Can you do it by patting his back and saying,
'Poor<br>
 Puss'? You are illogical. You want a battle fought, but you
object to<br>
 blows.--Well, I grant you the innocence you are so careful over.
I<br>
 have always found that there was material for hypocrisy in
honesty!<br>
 One day, three months hence, a poor priest will come to beg of
you<br>
 forty thousand francs for a pious work--a convent to be rebuilt
in the<br>
 Levant--in the desert.--If you are satisfied with your lot, give
the<br>
 good man the money. You will pay more than that into the
treasury. It<br>
 will be a mere trifle in comparison with what you will get, I
can tell<br>
 you."</p>

<p>She rose, standing on the broad feet that seemed to overflow
her satin<br>
 shoes; she smiled, bowed, and vanished.</p>

<p>"The Devil has a sister," said Victorin, rising.</p>

<p>He saw the hideous stranger to the door, a creature called up
from the<br>
 dens of the police, as on the stage a monster comes up from the
third<br>
 cellar at the touch of a fairy's wand in a
ballet-extravaganza.</p>

<p>After finishing what he had to do at the Courts, Victorin went
to call<br>
 on Monsieur Chapuzot, the head of one of the most important
branches<br>
 of the Central Police, to make some inquiries about the
stranger.<br>
 Finding Monsieur Chapuzot alone in his office, Victorin thanked
him<br>
 for his help.</p>

<p>"You sent me an old woman who might stand for the incarnation
of the<br>
 criminal side of Paris."</p>

<p>Monsieur Chapuzot laid his spectacles on his papers and looked
at the<br>
 lawyer with astonishment.</p>

<p>"I should not have taken the liberty of sending anybody to see
you<br>
 without giving you notice beforehand, or a line of
introduction," said<br>
 he.</p>

<p>"Then it was Monsieur le Prefet--?"</p>

<p>"I think not," said Chapuzot. "The last time that the Prince
de<br>
 Wissembourg dined with the Minister of the Interior, he spoke to
the<br>
 Prefet of the position in which you find yourself--a
deplorable<br>
 position--and asked him if you could be helped in any friendly
way.<br>
 The Prefet, who was interested by the regrets his Excellency
expressed<br>
 as to this family affair, did me the honor to consult me about
it.</p>

<p>"Ever since the present Prefet has held the reins of this
department--<br>
 so useful and so vilified--he has made it a rule that family
matters<br>
 are never to be interfered in. He is right in principle and
in<br>
 morality; but in practice he is wrong. In the forty-five years
that I<br>
 have served in the police, it did, from 1799 till 1815, great
services<br>
 in family concerns. Since 1820 a constitutional government and
the<br>
 press have completely altered the conditions of existence. So
my<br>
 advice, indeed, was not to intervene in such a case, and the
Prefet<br>
 did me the honor to agree with my remarks. The Head of the
detective<br>
 branch has orders, in my presence, to take no steps; so if you
have<br>
 had any one sent to you by him, he will be reprimanded. It might
cost<br>
 him his place. 'The Police will do this or that,' is easily
said; the<br>
 Police, the Police! But, my dear sir, the Marshal and the
Ministerial<br>
 Council do not know what the Police is. The Police alone knows
the<br>
 Police; but as for ours, only Fouche, Monsieur Lenoir, and
Monsieur de<br>
 Sartines have had any notion of it.--Everything is changed now;
we are<br>
 reduced and disarmed! I have seen many private disasters
develop,<br>
 which I could have checked with five grains of despotic
power.--We<br>
 shall be regretted by the very men who have crippled us when
they,<br>
 like you, stand face to face with some moral monstrosities,
which<br>
 ought to be swept away as we sweep away mud! In public affairs
the<br>
 Police is expected to foresee everything, or when the safety of
the<br>
 public is involved--but the family?--It is sacred! I would do
my<br>
 utmost to discover and hinder a plot against the King's life, I
would<br>
 see through the walls of a house; but as to laying a finger on
a<br>
 household, or peeping into private interests--never, so long as
I sit<br>
 in this office. I should be afraid."</p>

<p><br>
 "Of what?"</p>

<p>"Of the Press, Monsieur le Depute, of the left centre."</p>

<p>"What, then, can I do?" said Hulot, after a pause.</p>

<p>"Well, you are the Family," said the official. "That settles
it; you<br>
 can do what you please. But as to helping you, as to using the
Police<br>
 as an instrument of private feelings, and interests, how is
it<br>
 possible? There lies, you see, the secret of the
persecution,<br>
 necessary, but pronounced illegal, by the Bench, which was
brought to<br>
 bear against the predecessor of our present chief detective.
Bibi-<br>
 Lupin undertook investigations for the benefit of private
persons.<br>
 This might have led to great social dangers. With the means at
his<br>
 command, the man would have been formidable, an underlying
fate--"</p>

<p>"But in my place?" said Hulot.</p>

<p>"Why, you ask my advice? You who sell it!" replied Monsieur
Chapuzot.<br>
 "Come, come, my dear sir, you are making fun of me."</p>

<p>Hulot bowed to the functionary, and went away without seeing
that<br>
 gentleman's almost imperceptible shrug as he rose to open the
door.</p>

<p>"And he wants to be a statesman!" said Chapuzot to himself as
he<br>
 returned to his reports.</p>

<p>Victorin went home, still full of perplexities which he could
confide<br>
 to no one.</p>

<p>At dinner the Baroness joyfully announced to her children that
within<br>
 a month their father might be sharing their comforts, and end
his days<br>
 in peace among his family.</p>

<p>"Oh, I would gladly give my three thousand six hundred francs
a year<br>
 to see the Baron here!" cried Lisbeth. "But, my dear Adeline, do
not<br>
 dream beforehand of such happiness, I entreat you!"</p>

<p>"Lisbeth is right," said Celestine. "My dear mother, wait till
the<br>
 end."</p>

<p>The Baroness, all feeling and all hope, related her visit to
Josepha,<br>
 expressed her sense of the misery of such women in the midst of
good<br>
 fortune, and mentioned Chardin the mattress-picker, the father
of the<br>
 Oran storekeeper, thus showing that her hopes were not
groundless.</p>

<p>By seven next morning Lisbeth had driven in a hackney coach to
the<br>
 Quai de la Tournelle, and stopped the vehicle at the corner of
the Rue<br>
 de Poissy.</p>

<p>"Go to the Rue des Bernardins," said she to the driver, "No.
7, a<br>
 house with an entry and no porter. Go up to the fourth floor,
ring at<br>
 the door to the left, on which you will see 'Mademoiselle
Chardin--<br>
 Lace and shawls mended.' She will answer the door. Ask for
the<br>
 Chevalier. She will say he is out. Say in reply, 'Yes, I know,
but<br>
 find him, for his <i>bonne</i> is out on the quay in a coach,
and wants to<br>
 see him.' "</p>

<p>Twenty minutes later, an old man, who looked about eighty,
with<br>
 perfectly white hair, and a nose reddened by the cold, and a
pale,<br>
 wrinkled face like an old woman's, came shuffling slowly along
in list<br>
 slippers, a shiny alpaca overcoat hanging on his stooping
shoulders,<br>
 no ribbon at his buttonhole, the sleeves of an under-vest
showing<br>
 below his coat-cuffs, and his shirt-front unpleasantly dingy.
He<br>
 approached timidly, looked at the coach, recognized Lisbeth, and
came<br>
 to the window.</p>

<p>"Why, my dear cousin, what a state you are in!"</p>

<p>"Elodie keeps everything for herself," said Baron Hulot.
"Those<br>
 Chardins are a blackguard crew."</p>

<p>"Will you come home to us?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no, no!" cried the old man. "I would rather go to
America."</p>

<p>"Adeline is on the scent."</p>

<p>"Oh, if only some one would pay my debts!" said the Baron,
with a<br>
 suspicious look, "for Samanon is after me."</p>

<p>"We have not paid up the arrears yet; your son still owes a
hundred<br>
 thousand francs."</p>

<p>"Poor boy!"</p>

<p>"And your pension will not be free before seven or eight
months.--If<br>
 you will wait a minute, I have two thousand francs here."</p>

<p>The Baron held out his hand with fearful avidity.</p>

<p>"Give it me, Lisbeth, and may God reward you! Give it me; I
know where<br>
 to go."</p>

<p>"But you will tell me, old wretch?"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes. Then I can wait eight months, for I have discovered
a<br>
 little angel, a good child, an innocent thing not old enough to
be<br>
 depraved."</p>

<p>"Do not forget the police-court," said Lisbeth, who flattered
herself<br>
 that she would some day see Hulot there.</p>

<p>"No.--It is in the Rue de Charonne," said the Baron, "a part
of the<br>
 town where no fuss is made about anything. No one will ever find
me<br>
 there. I am called Pere Thorec, Lisbeth, and I shall be taken
for a<br>
 retired cabinet-maker; the girl is fond of me, and I will not
allow my<br>
 back to be shorn any more."</p>

<p>"No, that has been done," said Lisbeth, looking at his
coat.<br>
 "Supposing I take you there."</p>

<p>Baron Hulot got into the coach, deserting Mademoiselle Elodie
without<br>
 taking leave of her, as he might have tossed aside a novel he
had<br>
 finished.</p>

<p>In half an hour, during which Baron Hulot talked to Lisbeth of
nothing<br>
 but little Atala Judici--for he had fallen by degrees to those
base<br>
 passions that ruin old men--she set him down with two thousand
francs<br>
 in his pocket, in the Rue de Charonne, Faubourg Saint-Antoine,
at the<br>
 door of a doubtful and sinister-looking house.</p>

<p>"Good-day, cousin; so now you are to be called Thorec, I
suppose? Send<br>
 none but commissionaires if you need me, and always take them
from<br>
 different parts."</p>

<p>"Trust me! Oh, I am really very lucky!" said the Baron, his
face<br>
 beaming with the prospect of new and future happiness.</p>

<p>"No one can find him there," said Lisbeth; and she paid the
coach at<br>
 the Boulevard Beaumarchais, and returned to the Rue
Louis-le-Grand in<br>
 the omnibus.</p>

<p>On the following day Crevel was announced at the hour when all
the<br>
 family were together in the drawing-room, just after
breakfast.<br>
 Celestine flew to throw her arms round her father's neck, and
behaved<br>
 as if she had seen him only the day before, though in fact he
had not<br>
 called there for more than two years.</p>

<p>"Good-morning, father," said Victorin, offering his hand.</p>

<p>"Good-morning, children," said the pompous Crevel. "Madame la
Baronne,<br>
 I throw myself at your feet! Good Heavens, how the children
grow! they<br>
 are pushing us off the perch--'Grand-pa,' they say, 'we want our
turn<br>
 in the sunshine.'--Madame la Comtesse, you are as lovely as
ever," he<br>
 went on, addressing Hortense.--"Ah, ha! and here is the best of
good<br>
 money: Cousin Betty, the Wise Virgin."</p>

<p>"Why, you are really very comfortable here," said he, after
scattering<br>
 these greetings with a cackle of loud laughter that hardly moved
the<br>
 rubicund muscles of his broad face.</p>

<p>He looked at his daughter with some contempt.</p>

<p>"My dear Celestine, I will make you a present of all my
furniture out<br>
 of the Rue des Saussayes; it will just do here. Your
drawing-room<br>
 wants furnishing up.--Ha! there is that little rogue Wenceslas.
Well,<br>
 and are we very good children, I wonder? You must have pretty
manners,<br>
 you know."</p>

<p>"To make up for those who have none," said Lisbeth.</p>

<p>"That sarcasm, my dear Lisbeth, has lost its sting. I am
going, my<br>
 dear children, to put an end to the false position in which I
have so<br>
 long been placed; I have come, like a good father, to announce
my<br>
 approaching marriage without any circumlocution."</p>

<p>"You have a perfect right to marry," said Victorin. "And for
my part,<br>
 I give you back the promise you made me when you gave me the
hand of<br>
 my dear Celestine--"</p>

<p>"What promise?" said Crevel.</p>

<p>"Not to marry," replied the lawyer. "You will do me the
justice to<br>
 allow that I did not ask you to pledge yourself, that you gave
your<br>
 word quite voluntarily and in spite of my desire, for I pointed
out to<br>
 you at the time that you were unwise to bind yourself."</p>

<p>"Yes, I do remember, my dear fellow," said Crevel, ashamed of
himself.<br>
 "But, on my honor, if you will but live with Madame Crevel,
my<br>
 children, you will find no reason to repent.--Your good
feeling<br>
 touches me, Victorin, and you will find that generosity to me is
not<br>
 unrewarded.--Come, by the Poker! welcome your stepmother and
come to<br>
 the wedding."</p>

<p>"But you have not told us the lady's name, papa," said
Celestine.</p>

<p>"Why, it is an open secret," replied Crevel. "Do not let us
play at<br>
 guess who can! Lisbeth must have told you."</p>

<p>"My dear Monsieur Crevel," replied Lisbeth, "there are certain
names<br>
 we never utter here--"</p>

<p>"Well, then, it is Madame Marneffe."</p>

<p>"Monsieur Crevel," said the lawyer very sternly, "neither my
wife nor<br>
 I can be present at that marriage; not out of interest, for I
spoke in<br>
 all sincerity just now. Yes, I am most happy to think that you
may<br>
 find happiness in this union; but I act on considerations of
honor and<br>
 good feeling which you must understand, and which I cannot speak
of<br>
 here, as they reopen wounds still ready to bleed----"</p>

<p>The Baroness telegraphed a signal to Hortense, who tucked her
little<br>
 one under her arm, saying, "Come Wenceslas, and have your
bath!--Good-<br>
 bye, Monsieur Crevel."</p>

<p>The Baroness also bowed to Crevel without a word; and Crevel
could not<br>
 help smiling at the child's astonishment when threatened with
this<br>
 impromptu tubbing.</p>

<p>"You, monsieur," said Victorin, when he found himself alone
with<br>
 Lisbeth, his wife, and his father-in-law, "are about to marry a
woman<br>
 loaded with the spoils of my father; it was she who, in cold
blood,<br>
 brought him down to such depths; a woman who is the
son-in-law's<br>
 mistress after ruining the father-in-law; who is the cause of
constant<br>
 grief to my sister!--And you fancy that I shall seem to sanction
your<br>
 madness by my presence? I deeply pity you, dear Monsieur Crevel;
you<br>
 have no family feeling; you do not understand the unity of the
honor<br>
 which binds the members of it together. There is no arguing
with<br>
 passion--as I have too much reason to know. The slaves of
their<br>
 passions are as deaf as they are blind. Your daughter Celestine
has<br>
 too strong a sense of her duty to proffer a word of
reproach."</p>

<p>"That would, indeed, be a pretty thing!" cried Crevel, trying
to cut<br>
 short this harangue.</p>

<p>"Celestine would not be my wife if she made the slightest<br>
 remonstrance," the lawyer went on. "But I, at least, may try to
stop<br>
 you before you step over the precipice, especially after giving
you<br>
 ample proof of my disinterestedness. It is not your fortune, it
is you<br>
 that I care about. Nay, to make it quite plain to you, I may
add, if<br>
 it were only to set your mind at ease with regard to your
marriage<br>
 contract, that I am now in a position which leaves me with
nothing to<br>
 wish for--"</p>

<p>"Thanks to me!" exclaimed Crevel, whose face was purple.</p>

<p>"Thanks to Celestine's fortune," replied Victorin. "And if you
regret<br>
 having given to your daughter as a present from yourself, a sum
which<br>
 is not half what her mother left her, I can only say that we
are<br>
 prepared to give it back."</p>

<p>"And do you not know, my respected son-in-law," said Crevel,
striking<br>
 an attitude, "that under the shelter of my name Madame Marneffe
is not<br>
 called upon to answer for her conduct excepting as my wife--as
Madame<br>
 Crevel?"</p>

<p>"That is, no doubt, quite the correct thing," said the lawyer;
"very<br>
 generous so far as the affections are concerned and the vagaries
of<br>
 passion; but I know of no name, nor law, nor title that can
shelter<br>
 the theft of three hundred thousand francs so meanly wrung from
my<br>
 father!--I tell you plainly, my dear father-in-law, your future
wife<br>
 is unworthy of you, she is false to you, and is madly in love
with my<br>
 brother-in-law, Steinbock, whose debts she had paid."</p>

<p>"It is I who paid them!"</p>

<p>"Very good," said Hulot; "I am glad for Count Steinbock's
sake; he may<br>
 some day repay the money. But he is loved, much loved, and
often--"</p>

<p>"Loved!" cried Crevel, whose face showed his utter
bewilderment. "It<br>
 is cowardly, and dirty, and mean, and cheap, to calumniate a
woman!--<br>
 When a man says such things, monsieur, he must bring proof."</p>

<p>"I will bring proof."</p>

<p>"I shall expect it."</p>

<p>"By the day after to-morrow, my dear Monsieur Crevel, I shall
be able<br>
 to tell you the day, the hour, the very minute when I can expose
the<br>
 horrible depravity of your future wife."</p>

<p>"Very well; I shall be delighted," said Crevel, who had
recovered<br>
 himself.</p>

<p>"Good-bye, my children, for the present; good-bye,
Lisbeth."</p>

<p>"See him out, Lisbeth," said Celestine in an undertone.</p>

<p>"And is this the way you take yourself off?" cried Lisbeth to
Crevel.</p>

<p>"Ah, ha!" said Crevel, "my son-in-law is too clever by half;
he is<br>
 getting on. The Courts and the Chamber, judicial trickery
and<br>
 political dodges, are making a man of him with a vengeance!--So
he<br>
 knows I am to be married on Wednesday, and on a Sunday my
gentleman<br>
 proposes to fix the hour, within three days, when he can prove
that my<br>
 wife is unworthy of me. That is a good story!--Well, I am going
back<br>
 to sign the contract. Come with me, Lisbeth--yes, come. They
will<br>
 never know. I meant to have left Celestine forty thousand francs
a<br>
 year; but Hulot has just behaved in a way to alienate my
affection for<br>
 ever."</p>

<p>"Give me ten minutes, Pere Crevel; wait for me in your
carriage at the<br>
 gate. I will make some excuse for going out."</p>

<p>"Very well--all right."</p>

<p>"My dears," said Lisbeth, who found all the family reassembled
in the<br>
 drawing-room, "I am going with Crevel: the marriage contract is
to be<br>
 signed this afternoon, and I shall hear what he has settled. It
will<br>
 probably be my last visit to that woman. Your father is furious;
he<br>
 will disinherit you--"</p>

<p>"His vanity will prevent that," said the son-in-law. "He was
bent on<br>
 owning the estate of Presles, and he will keep it; I know him.
Even if<br>
 he were to have children, Celestine would still have half of
what he<br>
 might leave; the law forbids his giving away all his
fortune.--Still,<br>
 these questions are nothing to me; I am only thinking of our
honor.--<br>
 Go then, cousin," and he pressed Lisbeth's hand, "and listen
carefully<br>
 to the contract."</p>

<p>Twenty minutes after, Lisbeth and Crevel reached the house in
the Rue<br>
 Barbet, where Madame Marneffe was awaiting, in mild impatience,
the<br>
 result of a step taken by her commands. Valerie had in the end
fallen<br>
 a prey to the absorbing love which, once in her life, masters
a<br>
 woman's heart. Wenceslas was its object, and, a failure as an
artist,<br>
 he became in Madame Marneffe's hands a lover so perfect that he
was to<br>
 her what she had been to Baron Hulot.</p>

<p>Valerie was holding a slipper in one hand, and Steinbock
clasped the<br>
 other, while her head rested on his shoulder. The rambling<br>
 conversation in which they had been engaged ever since Crevel
went out<br>
 may be ticketed, like certain lengthy literary efforts of our
day,<br>
 "<i>All rights reserved</i>," for it cannot be reproduced. This
masterpiece<br>
 of personal poetry naturally brought a regret to the artist's
lips,<br>
 and he said, not without some bitterness:</p>

<p>"What a pity it is that I married; for if I had but waited, as
Lisbeth<br>
 told me, I might now have married you."</p>

<p>"Who but a Pole would wish to make a wife of a devoted
mistress?"<br>
 cried Valerie. "To change love into duty, and pleasure into a
bore."</p>

<p>"I know you to be so fickle," replied Steinbock. "Did I not
hear you<br>
 talking to Lisbeth of that Brazilian, Baron Montes?"</p>

<p>"Do you want to rid me of him?"</p>

<p>"It would be the only way to hinder his seeing you," said the
ex-<br>
 sculptor.</p>

<p>"Let me tell you, my darling--for I tell you everything," said
Valerie<br>
 --"I was saving him up for a husband.--The promises I have made
to<br>
 that man!--Oh, long before I knew you," said she, in reply to
a<br>
 movement from Wenceslas. "And those promises, of which he
avails<br>
 himself to plague me, oblige me to get married almost secretly;
for if<br>
 he should hear that I am marrying Crevel, he is the sort of man
that--<br>
 that would kill me."</p>

<p>"Oh, as to that!" said Steinbock, with a scornful expression,
which<br>
 conveyed that such a danger was small indeed for a woman beloved
by a<br>
 Pole.</p>

<p>And in the matter of valor there is no brag or bravado in a
Pole, so<br>
 thoroughly and seriously brave are they all.</p>

<p>"And that idiot Crevel," she went on, "who wants to make a
great<br>
 display and indulge his taste for inexpensive magnificence in
honor of<br>
 the wedding, places me in difficulties from which I see no
escape."</p>

<p>Could Valerie confess to this man, whom she adored, that since
the<br>
 discomfiture of Baron Hulot, this Baron Henri Montes had
inherited the<br>
 privilege of calling on her at all hours of the day or night;
and<br>
 that, notwithstanding her cleverness, she was still puzzled to
find a<br>
 cause of quarrel in which the Brazilian might seem to be solely
in the<br>
 wrong? She knew the Baron's almost savage temper--not unlike
Lisbeth's<br>
 --too well not to quake as she thought of this Othello of Rio
de<br>
 Janeiro.</p>

<p><br>
 As the carriage drove up, Steinbock released Valerie, for his
arm was<br>
 round her waist, and took up a newspaper, in which he was
found<br>
 absorbed. Valerie was stitching with elaborate care at the
slippers<br>
 she was working for Crevel.</p>

<p>"How they slander her!" whispered Lisbeth to Crevel, pointing
to this<br>
 picture as they opened the door. "Look at her hair--not in the
least<br>
 tumbled. To hear Victorin, you might have expected to find two
turtle-<br>
 doves in a nest."</p>

<p>"My dear Lisbeth," cried Crevel, in his favorite position,
"you see<br>
 that to turn Lucretia into Aspasia, you have only to inspire
a<br>
 passion!"</p>

<p>"And have I not always told you," said Lisbeth, "that women
like a<br>
 burly profligate like you?"</p>

<p>"And she would be most ungrateful, too," said Crevel; "for as
to the<br>
 money I have spent here, Grindot and I alone can tell!"</p>

<p>And he waved a hand at the staircase.</p>

<p>In decorating this house, which Crevel regarded as his own,
Grindot<br>
 had tried to compete with Cleretti, in whose hands the Duc<br>
 d'Herouville had placed Josepha's villa. But Crevel, incapable
of<br>
 understanding art, had, like all sordid souls, wanted to spend
a<br>
 certain sum fixed beforehand. Grindot, fettered by a contract,
had<br>
 found it impossible to embody his architectural dream.</p>

<p>The difference between Josepha's house and that in the Rue
Barbet was<br>
 just that between the individual stamp on things and commonness.
The<br>
 objects you admired at Crevel's were to be bought in any shop.
These<br>
 two types of luxury are divided by the river Million. A mirror,
if<br>
 unique, is worth six thousand francs; a mirror designed by a<br>
 manufacturer who turns them out by the dozen costs five hundred.
A<br>
 genuine lustre by Boulle will sell at a public auction for
three<br>
 thousand francs; the same thing reproduced by casting may be
made for<br>
 a thousand or twelve hundred; one is archaeologically what a
picture<br>
 by Raphael is in painting, the other is a copy. At what would
you<br>
 value a copy of a Raphael? Thus Crevel's mansion was a
splendid<br>
 example of the luxury of idiots, while Josepha's was a perfect
model<br>
 of an artist's home.</p>

<p>"War is declared," said Crevel, going up to Madame
Marneffe.</p>

<p>She rang the bell.</p>

<p>"Go and find Monsieur Berthier," said she to the man-servant,
"and do<br>
 not return without him. If you had succeeded," said she,
embracing<br>
 Crevel, "we would have postponed our happiness, my dear Daddy,
and<br>
 have given a really splendid entertainment; but when a whole
family is<br>
 set against a match, my dear, decency requires that the wedding
shall<br>
 be a quiet one, especially when the lady is a widow."</p>

<p>"On the contrary, I intend to make a display of magnificence
<i>a la</i><br>
 Louis XIV.," said Crevel, who of late had held the eighteenth
century<br>
 rather cheap. "I have ordered new carriages; there is one for
monsieur<br>
 and one for madame, two neat coupes; and a chaise, a
handsome<br>
 traveling carriage with a splendid hammercloth, on springs
that<br>
 tremble like Madame Hulot."</p>

<p>"Oh, ho! <i>You intend</i>?--Then you have ceased to be my
lamb?--No, no,<br>
 my friend, you will do what <i>I</i> intend. We will sign the
contract<br>
 quietly--just ourselves--this afternoon. Then, on Wednesday, we
will<br>
 be regularly married, really married, in mufti, as my poor
mother<br>
 would have said. We will walk to church, plainly dressed, and
have<br>
 only a low mass. Our witnesses are Stidmann, Steinbock, Vignon,
and<br>
 Massol, all wide-awake men, who will be at the mairie by chance,
and<br>
 who will so far sacrifice themselves as to attend mass.</p>

<p>"Your colleague will perform the civil marriage, for once in a
way, as<br>
 early as half-past nine. Mass is at ten; we shall be at home
to<br>
 breakfast by half-past eleven.</p>

<p>"I have promised our guests that we will sit at table till
the<br>
 evening. There will be Bixiou, your old official chum du
Tillet,<br>
 Lousteau, Vernisset, Leon de Lora, Vernou, all the wittiest men
in<br>
 Paris, who will not know that we are married. We will play them
a<br>
 little trick, we will get just a little tipsy, and Lisbeth must
join<br>
 us. I want her to study matrimony; Bixiou shall make love to
her, and<br>
 --and enlighten her darkness."</p>

<p>For two hours Madame Marneffe went on talking nonsense, and
Crevel<br>
 made this judicious reflection:</p>

<p>"How can so light-hearted a creature be utterly depraved?
Feather-<br>
 brained, yes! but wicked? Nonsense!"</p>

<p>"Well, and what did the young people say about me?" said
Valerie to<br>
 Crevel at a moment when he sat down by her on the sofa. "All
sorts of<br>
 horrors?"</p>

<p>"They will have it that you have a criminal passion for
Wenceslas--<br>
 you, who are virtue itself."</p>

<p>"I love him!--I should think so, my little Wenceslas!" cried
Valerie,<br>
 calling the artist to her, taking his face in her hands, and
kissing<br>
 his forehead. "A poor boy with no fortune, and no one to depend
on!<br>
 Cast off by a carrotty giraffe! What do you expect, Crevel?
Wenceslas<br>
 is my poet, and I love him as if he were my own child, and make
no<br>
 secret of it. Bah! your virtuous women see evil everywhere and
in<br>
 everything. Bless me, could they not sit by a man without doing
wrong?<br>
 I am a spoilt child who has had all it ever wanted, and bonbons
no<br>
 longer excite me.--Poor things! I am sorry for them!</p>

<p>"And who slandered me so?"</p>

<p>"Victorin," said Crevel.</p>

<p>"Then why did you not stop his mouth, the odious legal macaw!
with the<br>
 story of the two hundred thousand francs and his mamma?"</p>

<p>"Oh, the Baroness had fled," said Lisbeth.</p>

<p>"They had better take care, Lisbeth," said Madame Marneffe,
with a<br>
 frown. "Either they will receive me and do it handsomely, and
come to<br>
 their stepmother's house--all the party!--or I will see them in
lower<br>
 depths than the Baron has reached, and you may tell them I said
so!--<br>
 At last I shall turn nasty. On my honor, I believe that evil is
the<br>
 scythe with which to cut down the good."</p>

<p>At three o'clock Monsieur Berthier, Cardot's successor, read
the<br>
 marriage-contract, after a short conference with Crevel, for
some of<br>
 the articles were made conditional on the action taken by
Monsieur and<br>
 Madame Victorin Hulot.</p>

<p>Crevel settled on his wife a fortune consisting, in the first
place,<br>
 of forty thousand francs in dividends on specified
securities;<br>
 secondly, of the house and all its contents; and thirdly, of
three<br>
 million francs not invested. He also assigned to his wife
every<br>
 benefit allowed by law; he left all the property free of duty;
and in<br>
 the event of their dying without issue, each devised to the
survivor<br>
 the whole of their property and real estate.</p>

<p>By this arrangement the fortune left to Celestine and her
husband was<br>
 reduced to two millions of francs in capital. If Crevel and his
second<br>
 wife should have children, Celestine's share was limited to
five<br>
 hundred thousand francs, as the life-interest in the rest was
to<br>
 accrue to Valerie. This would be about the ninth part of his
whole<br>
 real and personal estate.</p>

<p>Lisbeth returned to dine in the Rue Louis-le-Grand, despair
written on<br>
 her face. She explained and bewailed the terms of the
marriage-<br>
 contract, but found Celestine and her husband insensible to
the<br>
 disastrous news.</p>

<p>"You have provoked your father, my children. Madame Marneffe
swears<br>
 that you shall receive Monsieur Crevel's wife and go to her
house,"<br>
 said she.</p>

<p>"Never!" said Victorin.</p>

<p>"Never!" said Celestine.</p>

<p>"Never!" said Hortense.</p>

<p>Lisbeth was possessed by the wish to crush the haughty
attitude<br>
 assumed by all the Hulots.</p>

<p>"She seems to have arms that she can turn against you," she
replied.<br>
 "I do not know all about it, but I shall find out. She spoke
vaguely<br>
 of some history of two hundred thousand francs in which Adeline
is<br>
 implicated."</p>

<p>The Baroness fell gently backward on the sofa she was sitting
on in a<br>
 fit of hysterical sobbing.</p>

<p>"Go there, go, my children!" she cried. "Receive the woman!
Monsieur<br>
 Crevel is an infamous wretch. He deserves the worst
punishment<br>
 imaginable.--Do as the woman desires you! She is a monster--she
knows<br>
 all!"</p>

<p>After gasping out these words with tears and sobs, Madame
Hulot<br>
 collected her strength to go to her room, leaning on her
daughter and<br>
 Celestine.</p>

<p>"What is the meaning of all this?" cried Lisbeth, left alone
with<br>
 Victorin.</p>

<p>The lawyer stood rigid, in very natural dismay, and did not
hear her.</p>

<p>"What is the matter, my dear Victorin?"</p>

<p>"I am horrified!" said he, and his face scowled darkly. "Woe
to<br>
 anybody who hurts my mother! I have no scruples then. I would
crush<br>
 that woman like a viper if I could!--What, does she attack my
mother's<br>
 life, my mother's honor?"</p>

<p>"She said, but do not repeat it, my dear Victorin--she said
you should<br>
 all fall lower even than your father. And she scolded Crevel
roundly<br>
 for not having shut your mouths with this secret that seems to
be such<br>
 a terror to Adeline."</p>

<p>A doctor was sent for, for the Baroness was evidently worse.
He gave<br>
 her a draught containing a large dose of opium, and Adeline,
having<br>
 swallowed it, fell into a deep sleep; but the whole family
were<br>
 greatly alarmed.</p>

<p>Early next morning Victorin went out, and on his way to the
Courts<br>
 called at the Prefecture of the Police, where he begged Vautrin,
the<br>
 head of the detective department, to send him Madame de
Saint-Esteve.</p>

<p>"We are forbidden, monsieur, to meddle in your affairs; but
Madame de<br>
 Saint-Esteve is in business, and will attend to your orders,"
replied<br>
 this famous police officer.</p>

<p>On his return home, the unhappy lawyer was told that his
mother's<br>
 reason was in danger. Doctor Bianchon, Doctor Larabit, and
Professor<br>
 Angard had met in consultation, and were prepared to apply
heroic<br>
 remedies to hinder the rush of blood to the head. At the moment
when<br>
 Victorin was listening to Doctor Bianchon, who was giving him,
at some<br>
 length, his reasons for hoping that the crisis might be got
over, the<br>
 man-servant announced that a client, Madame de Saint-Esteve,
was<br>
 waiting to see him. Victorin left Bianchon in the middle of a
sentence<br>
 and flew downstairs like a madman.</p>

<p><br>
 "Is there any hereditary lunacy in the family?" said
Bianchon,<br>
 addressing Larabit.</p>

<p>The doctors departed, leaving a hospital attendant, instructed
by<br>
 them, to watch Madame Hulot.</p>

<p>"A whole life of virtue!----" was the only sentence the
sufferer had<br>
 spoken since the attack.</p>

<p>Lisbeth never left Adeline's bedside; she sat up all night,
and was<br>
 much admired by the two younger women.</p>

<p>"Well, my dear Madame de Saint-Esteve," said Victorin, showing
the<br>
 dreadful old woman into his study and carefully shutting the
doors,<br>
 "how are we getting on?"</p>

<p>"Ah, ha! my dear friend," said she, looking at Victorin with
cold<br>
 irony. "So you have thought things over?"</p>

<p>"Have you done anything?"</p>

<p>"Will you pay fifty thousand francs?"</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Victorin, "for we must get on. Do you know that
by one<br>
 single phrase that woman has endangered my mother's life and
reason?<br>
 So, I say, get on."</p>

<p>"We have got on!" replied the old woman.</p>

<p>"Well?" cried Victorin, with a gulp.</p>

<p>"Well, you do not cry off the expenses?"</p>

<p>"On the contrary."</p>

<p>"They run up to twenty-three thousand francs already."</p>

<p>Victorin looked helplessly at the woman.</p>

<p>"Well, could we hoodwink you, you, one of the shining lights
of the<br>
 law?" said she. "For that sum we have secured a maid's
conscience and<br>
 a picture by Raphael.--It is not dear."</p>

<p>Hulot, still bewildered, sat with wide open eyes.</p>

<p>"Well, then," his visitor went on, "we have purchased the
honesty of<br>
 Mademoiselle Reine Tousard, a damsel from whom Madame Marneffe
has no<br>
 secrets--"</p>

<p>"I understand!"</p>

<p>"But if you shy, say so."</p>

<p>"I will play blindfold," he replied. "My mother has told me
that that<br>
 couple deserve the worst torments--"</p>

<p>"The rack is out of date," said the old woman.</p>

<p>"You answer for the result?"</p>

<p>"Leave it all to me," said the woman; "your vengeance is
simmering."</p>

<p>She looked at the clock; it was six.</p>

<p>"Your avenger is dressing; the fires are lighted at the
<i>Rocher de</i><br>
 <i>Cancale</i>; the horses are pawing the ground; my irons are
getting hot.<br>
 --Oh, I know your Madame Marneffe by heart!-- Everything is
ready. And<br>
 there are some boluses in the rat-trap; I will tell you
to-morrow<br>
 morning if the mouse is poisoned. I believe she will be; good
evening,<br>
 my son."</p>

<p>"Good-bye, madame."</p>

<p>"Do you know English?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Well, my son, thou shalt be King. That is to say, you shall
come into<br>
 your inheritance," said the dreadful old witch, foreseen by<br>
 Shakespeare, and who seemed to know her Shakespeare.</p>

<p>She left Hulot amazed at the door of his study.</p>

<p>"The consultation is for to-morrow!" said she, with the
gracious air<br>
 of a regular client.</p>

<p>She saw two persons coming, and wished to pass in their eyes
a<br>
 pinchbeck countess.</p>

<p>"What impudence!" thought Hulot, bowing to his pretended
client.</p>

<p>Baron Montes de Montejanos was a <i>lion</i>, but a lion not
accounted for.<br>
 Fashionable Paris, Paris of the turf and of the town, admired
the<br>
 ineffable waistcoats of this foreign gentleman, his spotless
patent-<br>
 leather boots, his incomparable sticks, his much-coveted horses,
and<br>
 the negro servants who rode the horses and who were entirely
slaves<br>
 and most consumedly thrashed.</p>

<p>His fortune was well known; he had a credit account up to
seven<br>
 hundred thousand francs in the great banking house of du Tillet;
but<br>
 he was always seen alone. When he went to "first nights," he was
in a<br>
 stall. He frequented no drawing-rooms. He had never given his
arm to a<br>
 girl on the streets. His name would not be coupled with that of
any<br>
 pretty woman of the world. To pass his time he played whist at
the<br>
 Jockey-Club. The world was reduced to calumny, or, which it
thought<br>
 funnier, to laughing at his peculiarities; he went by the name
of<br>
 Combabus.</p>

<p>Bixiou, Leon de Lora, Lousteau, Florine, Mademoiselle
Heloise<br>
 Brisetout, and Nathan, supping one evening with the
notorious<br>
 Carabine, with a large party of <i>lions</i> and
<i>lionesses</i>, had invented<br>
 this name with an excessively burlesque explanation. Massol, as
being<br>
 on the Council of State, and Claude Vignon, erewhile Professor
of<br>
 Greek, had related to the ignorant damsels the famous
anecdote,<br>
 preserved in Rollin's <i>Ancient History</i>, concerning
Combabus, that<br>
 voluntary Abelard who was placed in charge of the wife of a King
of<br>
 Assyria, Persia, Bactria, Mesopotamia, and other
geographical<br>
 divisions peculiar to old Professor du Bocage, who continued the
work<br>
 of d'Anville, the creator of the East of antiquity. This
nickname,<br>
 which gave Carabine's guests laughter for a quarter of an hour,
gave<br>
 rise to a series of over-free jests, to which the Academy could
not<br>
 award the Montyon prize; but among which the name was taken up,
to<br>
 rest thenceforth on the curly mane of the handsome Baron, called
by<br>
 Josepha the splendid Brazilian--as one might say a splendid<br>
 <i>Catoxantha</i>.</p>

<p>Carabine, the loveliest of her tribe, whose delicate beauty
and<br>
 amusing wit had snatched the sceptre of the Thirteenth
Arrondissement<br>
 from the hands of Mademoiselle Turquet, better known by the name
of<br>
 Malaga--Mademoiselle Seraphine Sinet (this was her real name)
was to<br>
 du Tillet the banker what Josepha Mirah was to the Duc
d'Herouville.</p>

<p>Now, on the morning of the very day when Madame de
Saint-Esteve had<br>
 prophesied success to Victorin, Carabine had said to du Tillet
at<br>
 about seven o'clock:</p>

<p>"If you want to be very nice, you will give me a dinner at the
<i>Rocher</i><br>
 <i>de Cancale</i> and bring Combabus. We want to know, once for
all, whether<br>
 he has a mistress.--I bet that he has, and I should like to
win."</p>

<p>"He is still at the Hotel des Princes; I will call," replied
du<br>
 Tillet. "We will have some fun. Ask all the youngsters--the
youngster<br>
 Bixiou, the youngster Lora, in short, all the clan."</p>

<p>At half-past seven that evening, in the handsomest room of
the<br>
 restaurant where all Europe has dined, a splendid silver service
was<br>
 spread, made on purpose for entertainments where vanity pays the
bill<br>
 in bank-notes. A flood of light fell in ripples on the chased
rims;<br>
 waiters, whom a provincial might have taken for diplomatists but
for<br>
 their age, stood solemnly, as knowing themselves to be
overpaid.</p>

<p>Five guests had arrived, and were waiting for nine more. These
were<br>
 first and foremost Bixiou, still flourishing in 1843, the salt
of<br>
 every intellectual dish, always supplied with fresh wit--a
phenomenon<br>
 as rare in Paris as virtue is; Leon de Lora, the greatest
living<br>
 painter of landscape and the sea who has this great advantage
over all<br>
 his rivals, that he has never fallen below his first successes.
The<br>
 courtesans could never dispense with these two kings of ready
wit. No<br>
 supper, no dinner, was possible without them.</p>

<p>Seraphine Sinet, <i>dite</i> Carabine, as the mistress <i>en
titre</i> of the<br>
 Amphitryon, was one of the first to arrive; and the brilliant
lighting<br>
 showed off her shoulders, unrivaled in Paris, her throat, as
round as<br>
 if turned in a lathe, without a crease, her saucy face, and
dress of<br>
 satin brocade in two shades of blue, trimmed with Honiton lace
enough<br>
 to have fed a whole village for a month.</p>

<p>Pretty Jenny Cadine, not acting that evening, came in a dress
of<br>
 incredible splendor; her portrait is too well known to need
any<br>
 description. A party is always a Longchamps of evening dress for
these<br>
 ladies, each anxious to win the prize for her millionaire by
thus<br>
 announcing to her rivals:</p>

<p>"This is the price I am worth!"</p>

<p>A third woman, evidently at the initial stage of her career,
gazed,<br>
 almost shamefaced, at the luxury of her two established and
wealthy<br>
 companions. Simply dressed in white cashmere trimmed with blue,
her<br>
 head had been dressed with real flowers by a coiffeur of the
old-<br>
 fashioned school, whose awkward hands had unconsciously given
the<br>
 charm of ineptitude to her fair hair. Still unaccustomed to
any<br>
 finery, she showed the timidity--to use a hackneyed phrase--<br>
 inseparable from a first appearance. She had come from Valognes
to<br>
 find in Paris some use for her distracting youthfulness, her
innocence<br>
 that might have stirred the senses of a dying man, and her
beauty,<br>
 worthy to hold its own with any that Normandy has ever supplied
to the<br>
 theatres of the capital. The lines of that unblemished face were
the<br>
 ideal of angelic purity. Her milk-white skin reflected the light
like<br>
 a mirror. The delicate pink in her cheeks might have been laid
on with<br>
 a brush. She was called Cydalise, and, as will be seen, she was
an<br>
 important pawn in the game played by Ma'ame Nourrisson to
defeat<br>
 Madame Marneffe.</p>

<p>"Your arm is not a match for your name, my child," said Jenny
Cadine,<br>
 to whom Carabine had introduced this masterpiece of sixteen,
having<br>
 brought her with her.</p>

<p>And, in fact, Cydalise displayed to public admiration a fine
pair of<br>
 arms, smooth and satiny, but red with healthy young blood.</p>

<p>"What do you want for her?" said Jenny Cadine, in an undertone
to<br>
 Carabine.</p>

<p>"A fortune."</p>

<p>"What are you going to do with her?"</p>

<p>"Well--Madame Combabus!"</p>

<p>"And what are you to get for such a job?"</p>

<p>"Guess."</p>

<p>"A service of plate?"</p>

<p>"I have three."</p>

<p>"Diamonds?"</p>

<p>"I am selling them."</p>

<p>"A green monkey?"</p>

<p>"No. A picture by Raphael."</p>

<p>"What maggot is that in your brain?"</p>

<p>"Josepha makes me sick with her pictures," said Carabine. "I
want some<br>
 better than hers."</p>

<p>Du Tillet came with the Brazilian, the hero of the feast; the
Duc<br>
 d'Herouville followed with Josepha. The singer wore a plain
velvet<br>
 gown, but she had on a necklace worth a hundred and twenty
thousand<br>
 francs, pearls hardly distinguishable from her skin like
white<br>
 camellia petals. She had stuck one scarlet camellia in her black
hair<br>
 --a patch--the effect was dazzling, and she had amused herself
by<br>
 putting eleven rows of pearls on each arm. As she shook hands
with<br>
 Jenny Cadine, the actress said, "Lend me your mittens!"</p>

<p>Josepha unclasped them one by one and handed them to her
friend on a<br>
 plate.</p>

<p>"There's style!" said Carabine. "Quite the Duchess! You have
robbed<br>
 the ocean to dress the nymph, Monsieur le Duc," she added
turning to<br>
 the little Duc d'Herouville.</p>

<p>The actress took two of the bracelets; she clasped the other
twenty on<br>
 the singer's beautiful arms, which she kissed.</p>

<p>Lousteau, the literary cadger, la Palferine and Malaga,
Massol,<br>
 Vauvinet, and Theodore Gaillard, a proprietor of one of the
most<br>
 important political newspapers, completed the party. The Duc<br>
 d'Herouville, polite to everybody, as a fine gentleman knows how
to<br>
 be, greeted the Comte de la Palferine with the particular nod
which,<br>
 while it does not imply either esteem or intimacy, conveys to
all the<br>
 world, "We are of the same race, the same blood--equals!"--And
this<br>
 greeting, the shibboleth of the aristocracy, was invented to be
the<br>
 despair of the upper citizen class.</p>

<p><br>
 Carabine placed Combabus on her left, and the Duc d'Herouville
on her<br>
 right. Cydalise was next to the Brazilian, and beyond her was
Bixiou.<br>
 Malaga sat by the Duke.</p>

<p>Oysters appeared at seven o'clock; at eight they were drinking
iced<br>
 punch. Every one is familiar with the bill of fare of such a
banquet.<br>
 By nine o'clock they were talking as people talk after
forty-two<br>
 bottles of various wines, drunk by fourteen persons. Dessert was
on<br>
 the table, the odious dessert of the month of April. Of all the
party,<br>
 the only one affected by the heady atmosphere was Cydalise, who
was<br>
 humming a tune. None of the party, with the exception of the
poor<br>
 country girl, had lost their reason; the drinkers and the women
were<br>
 the experienced <i>elite</i> of the society that sups. Their
wits were<br>
 bright, their eyes glistened, but with no loss of intelligence,
though<br>
 the talk drifted into satire, anecdote, and gossip.
Conversation,<br>
 hitherto confined to the inevitable circle of racing,
horses,<br>
 hammerings on the Bourse, the different occupations of the
<i>lions</i><br>
 themselves, and the scandals of the town, showed a tendency to
break<br>
 up into intimate <i>tete-a-tete,</i> the dialogues of two
hearts.</p>

<p>And at this stage, at a signal from Carabine to Leon de Lora,
Bixiou,<br>
 la Palferine, and du Tillet, love came under discussion.</p>

<p>"A doctor in good society never talks of medicine, true nobles
never<br>
 speak of their ancestors, men of genius do not discuss their
works,"<br>
 said Josepha; "why should we talk business? If I got the opera
put off<br>
 in order to dine here, it was assuredly not to work.--So let us
change<br>
 the subject, dear children."</p>

<p>"But we are speaking of real love, my beauty," said Malaga,
"of the<br>
 love that makes a man fling all to the dogs--father, mother,
wife,<br>
 children--and retire to Clichy."</p>

<p>"Talk away, then, 'don't know yer,' " said the singer.</p>

<p>The slang words, borrowed from the Street Arab, and spoken by
these<br>
 women, may be a poem on their lips, helped by the expression of
the<br>
 eyes and face.</p>

<p>"What, do not I love you, Josepha?" said the Duke in a low
voice.</p>

<p>"You, perhaps, may love me truly," said she in his ear, and
she<br>
 smiled. "But I do not love you in the way they describe, with
such<br>
 love as makes the world dark in the absence of the man beloved.
You<br>
 are delightful to me, useful--but not indispensable; and if you
were<br>
 to throw me over to-morrow, I could have three dukes for
one."</p>

<p>"Is true love to be found in Paris?" asked Leon de Lora. "Men
have not<br>
 even time to make a fortune; how can they give themselves over
to true<br>
 love, which swamps a man as water melts sugar? A man must be<br>
 enormously rich to indulge in it, for love annihilates
him--for<br>
 instance, like our Brazilian friend over there. As I said long
ago,<br>
 'Extremes defeat--themselves.' A true lover is like an eunuch;
women<br>
 have ceased to exist for him. He is mystical; he is like the
true<br>
 Christian, an anchorite of the desert!--See our noble
Brazilian."</p>

<p>Every one at table looked at Henri Montes de Montejanos, who
was shy<br>
 at finding every eye centred on him.</p>

<p>"He has been feeding there for an hour without discovering,
any more<br>
 than an ox at pasture, that he is sitting next to--I will not
say, in<br>
 such company, the loveliest--but the freshest woman in all
Paris."</p>

<p>"Everything is fresh here, even the fish; it is what the house
is<br>
 famous for," said Carabine.</p>

<p>Baron Montes looked good-naturedly at the painter, and
said:</p>

<p>"Very good! I drink to your very good health," and bowing to
Leon de<br>
 Lora, he lifted his glass of port wine and drank it with much
dignity.</p>

<p>"Are you then truly in love?" asked Malaga of her neighbor,
thus<br>
 interpreting his toast.</p>

<p>The Brazilian refilled his glass, bowed to Carabine, and drank
again.</p>

<p>"To the lady's health then!" said the courtesan, in such a
droll tone<br>
 that Lora, du Tillet, and Bixiou burst out laughing.</p>

<p>The Brazilian sat like a bronze statue. This impassibility
provoked<br>
 Carabine. She knew perfectly well that Montes was devoted to
Madame<br>
 Marneffe, but she had not expected this dogged fidelity,
this<br>
 obstinate silence of conviction.</p>

<p>A woman is as often gauged by the attitude of her lover as a
man is<br>
 judged from the tone of his mistress. The Baron was proud of
his<br>
 attachment to Valerie, and of hers to him; his smile had, to
these<br>
 experienced connoisseurs, a touch of irony; he was really grand
to<br>
 look upon; wine had not flushed him; and his eyes, with their
peculiar<br>
 lustre as of tarnished gold, kept the secrets of his soul.
Even<br>
 Carabine said to herself:</p>

<p>"What a woman she must be! How she has sealed up that
heart!"</p>

<p>"He is a rock!" said Bixiou in an undertone, imagining that
the whole<br>
 thing was a practical joke, and never suspecting the importance
to<br>
 Carabine of reducing this fortress.</p>

<p>While this conversation, apparently so frivolous, was going on
at<br>
 Carabine's right, the discussion of love was continued on her
left<br>
 between the Duc d'Herouville, Lousteau, Josepha, Jenny Cadine,
and<br>
 Massol. They were wondering whether such rare phenomena were
the<br>
 result of passion, obstinacy, or affection. Josepha, bored to
death by<br>
 it all, tried to change the subject.</p>

<p>"You are talking of what you know nothing about. Is there a
man among<br>
 you who ever loved a woman--a woman beneath him--enough to
squander<br>
 his fortune and his children's, to sacrifice his future and
blight his<br>
 past, to risk going to the hulks for robbing the Government, to
kill<br>
 an uncle and a brother, to let his eye be so effectually blinded
that<br>
 he did not even perceive that it was done to hinder his seeing
the<br>
 abyss into which, as a crowning jest, he was being driven? Du
Tillet<br>
 has a cash-box under his left breast; Leon de Lora has his wit;
Bixiou<br>
 would laugh at himself for a fool if he loved any one but
himself;<br>
 Massol has a minister's portfolio in the place of a heart;
Lousteau<br>
 can have nothing but viscera, since he could endure to be thrown
over<br>
 by Madame de Baudraye; Monsieur le Duc is too rich to prove his
love<br>
 by his ruin; Vauvinet is not in it--I do not regard a
bill-broker as<br>
 one of the human race; and you have never loved, nor I, nor
Jenny<br>
 Cadine, nor Malaga. For my part, I never but once even saw
the<br>
 phenomenon I have described. It was," and she turned to Jenny
Cadine,<br>
 "that poor Baron Hulot, whom I am going to advertise for like a
lost<br>
 dog, for I want to find him."</p>

<p>"Oh, ho!" said Carabine to herself, and looking keenly at
Josepha,<br>
 "then Madame Nourrisson has two pictures by Raphael, since
Josepha is<br>
 playing my hand!"</p>

<p>"Poor fellow," said Vauvinet, "he was a great man!
Magnificent! And<br>
 what a figure, what a style, the air of Francis I.! What a
volcano!<br>
 and how full of ingenious ways of getting money! He must be
looking<br>
 for it now, wherever he is, and I make no doubt he extracts it
even<br>
 from the walls built of bones that you may see in the suburbs of
Paris<br>
 near the city gates--"</p>

<p>"And all that," said Bixiou, "for that little Madame Marneffe!
There<br>
 is a precious hussy for you!"</p>

<p>"She is just going to marry my friend Crevel," said du
Tillet.</p>

<p>"And she is madly in love with my friend Steinbock," Leon de
Lora put<br>
 in.</p>

<p>These three phrases were like so many pistol-shots fired
point-blank<br>
 at Montes. He turned white, and the shock was so painful that he
rose<br>
 with difficulty.</p>

<p>"You are a set of blackguards!" cried he. "You have no right
to speak<br>
 the name of an honest woman in the same breath with those
fallen<br>
 creatures--above all, not to make it a mark for your
slander!"</p>

<p>He was interrupted by unanimous bravos and applause. Bixiou,
Leon de<br>
 Lora, Vauvinet, du Tillet, and Massol set the example, and there
was a<br>
 chorus.</p>

<p>"Hurrah for the Emperor!" said Bixiou.</p>

<p>"Crown him! crown him!" cried Vauvinet.</p>

<p>"Three groans for such a good dog! Hurrah for Brazil!" cried
Lousteau.</p>

<p>"So, my copper-colored Baron, it is our Valerie that you love;
and you<br>
 are not disgusted?" said Leon de Lora.</p>

<p>"His remark is not parliamentary, but it is grand!" observed
Massol.</p>

<p>"But, my most delightful customer," said du Tillet, "you
were<br>
 recommended to me; I am your banker; your innocence reflects on
my<br>
 credit."</p>

<p>"Yes, tell me, you are a reasonable creature----" said the
Brazilian<br>
 to the banker.</p>

<p>"Thanks on behalf of the company," said Bixiou with a bow.</p>

<p>"Tell me the real facts," Montes went on, heedless of
Bixiou's<br>
 interjection.</p>

<p>"Well, then," replied du Tillet, "I have the honor to tell you
that I<br>
 am asked to the Crevel wedding."</p>

<p>"Ah, ha! Combabus holds a brief for Madame Marneffe!" said
Josepha,<br>
 rising solemnly.</p>

<p>She went round to Montes with a tragic look, patted him kindly
on the<br>
 head, looked at him for a moment with comical admiration, and
nodded<br>
 sagely.</p>

<p>"Hulot was the first instance of love through fire and water,"
said<br>
 she; "this is the second. But it ought not to count, as it comes
from<br>
 the Tropics."</p>

<p>Montes had dropped into his chair again, when Josepha gently
touched<br>
 his forehead, and looked at du Tillet as he said:</p>

<p>"If I am the victim of a Paris jest, if you only wanted to get
at my<br>
 secret----" and he sent a flashing look round the table,
embracing all<br>
 the guests in a flaming glance that blazed with the sun of
Brazil,--"I<br>
 beg of you as a favor to tell me so," he went on, in a tone of
almost<br>
 childlike entreaty; "but do not vilify the woman I love."</p>

<p>"Nay, indeed," said Carabine in a low voice; "but if, on the
contrary,<br>
 you are shamefully betrayed, cheated, tricked by Valerie, if I
should<br>
 give you the proof in an hour, in my own house, what then?"</p>

<p>"I cannot tell you before all these Iagos," said the
Brazilian.</p>

<p>Carabine understood him to say <i>magots</i> (baboons).</p>

<p>"Well, well, say no more!" she replied, smiling. "Do not make
yourself<br>
 a laughing-stock for all the wittiest men in Paris; come to my
house,<br>
 we will talk it over."</p>

<p>Montes was crushed. "Proofs," he stammered, "consider--"</p>

<p>"Only too many," replied Carabine; "and if the mere suspicion
hits you<br>
 so hard, I fear for your reason."</p>

<p>"Is this creature obstinate, I ask you? He is worse than the
late<br>
 lamented King of Holland!--I say, Lousteau, Bixiou, Massol, all
the<br>
 crew of you, are you not invited to breakfast with Madame
Marneffe the<br>
 day after to-morrow?" said Leon de Lora.</p>

<p>"<i>Ya</i>," said du Tillet; "I have the honor of assuring
you, Baron, that<br>
 if you had by any chance thought of marrying Madame Marneffe,
you are<br>
 thrown out like a bill in Parliament, beaten by a blackball
called<br>
 Crevel. My friend, my old comrade Crevel, has eighty thousand
francs a<br>
 year; and you, I suppose, did not show such a good hand, for if
you<br>
 had, you, I imagine, would have been preferred."</p>

<p>Montes listened with a half-absent, half-smiling expression,
which<br>
 struck them all with terror.</p>

<p>At this moment the head-waiter came to whisper to Carabine
that a<br>
 lady, a relation of hers, was in the drawing-room and wished to
speak<br>
 to her.</p>

<p>Carabine rose and went out to find Madame Nourrisson, decently
veiled<br>
 with black lace.</p>

<p>"Well, child, am I to go to your house? Has he taken the
hook?"</p>

<p>"Yes, mother; and the pistol is so fully loaded, that my only
fear is<br>
 that it will burst," said Carabine.</p>

<p>About an hour later, Montes, Cydalise, and Carabine, returning
from<br>
 the <i>Rocher de Cancale</i>, entered Carabine's little
sitting-room in the<br>
 Rue Saint-Georges. Madame Nourrisson was sitting in an armchair
by the<br>
 fire.</p>

<p>"Here is my worthy old aunt," said Carabine.</p>

<p>"Yes, child, I came in person to fetch my little allowance.
You would<br>
 have forgotten me, though you are kind-hearted, and I have some
bills<br>
 to pay to-morrow. Buying and selling clothes, I am always short
of<br>
 cash. Who is this at your heels? The gentleman looks very much
put out<br>
 about something."</p>

<p><br>
 The dreadful Madame Nourrisson, at this moment so completely
disguised<br>
 as to look like a respectable old body, rose to embrace
Carabine, one<br>
 of the hundred and odd courtesans she had launched on their
horrible<br>
 career of vice.</p>

<p>"He is an Othello who is not to be taken in, whom I have the
honor of<br>
 introducing to you--Monsieur le Baron Montes de Montejanos."</p>

<p>"Oh! I have heard him talked about, and know his name.--You
are<br>
 nicknamed Combabus, because you love but one woman, and in
Paris, that<br>
 is the same as loving no one at all. And is it by chance the
object of<br>
 your affections who is fretting you? Madame Marneffe, Crevel's
woman?<br>
 I tell you what, my dear sir, you may bless your stars instead
of<br>
 cursing them. She is a good-for-nothing baggage, is that little
woman.<br>
 I know her tricks!"</p>

<p>"Get along," said Carabine, into whose hand Madame Nourrisson
had<br>
 slipped a note while embracing her, "you do not know your
Brazilians.<br>
 They are wrong-headed creatures that insist on being impaled
through<br>
 the heart. The more jealous they are, the more jealous they want
to<br>
 be. Monsieur talks of dealing death all round, but he will kill
nobody<br>
 because he is in love.--However, I have brought him here to give
him<br>
 the proofs of his discomfiture, which I have got from that
little<br>
 Steinbock."</p>

<p>Montes was drunk; he listened as if the women were talking
about<br>
 somebody else.</p>

<p>Carabine went to take off her velvet wrap, and read a
facsimile of a<br>
 note, as follows:--</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"DEAR PUSS.--He dines with Popinot this evening, and will come
to<br>
 fetch me from the Opera at eleven. I shall go out at about
half-<br>
 past five and count on finding you at our paradise. Order
dinner<br>
 to be sent in from the <i>Maison d'or</i>. Dress, so as to be
able to<br>
 take me to the Opera. We shall have four hours to ourselves.<br>
 Return this note to me; not that your Valerie doubts you--I
would<br>
 give you my life, my fortune, and my honor, but I am afraid of
the<br>
 tricks of chance."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>"Here, Baron, this is the note sent to Count Steinbock this
morning;<br>
 read the address. The original document is burnt."</p>

<p><br>
 Montes turned the note over and over, recognized the writing,
and was<br>
 struck by a rational idea, which is sufficient evidence of
the<br>
 disorder of his brain.</p>

<p>"And, pray," said he, looking at Carabine, "what object have
you in<br>
 torturing my heart, for you must have paid very dear for the
privilege<br>
 of having the note in your possession long enough to get it<br>
 lithographed?"</p>

<p>"Foolish man!" said Carabine, at a nod from Madame Nourrisson,
"don't<br>
 you see that poor child Cydalise--a girl of sixteen, who has
been<br>
 pining for you these three months, till she has lost her
appetite for<br>
 food or drink, and who is heart-broken because you have never
even<br>
 glanced at her?"</p>

<p>Cydalise put her handkerchief to her eyes with an appearance
of<br>
 emotion--"She is furious," Carabine went on, "though she looks
as if<br>
 butter would not melt in her mouth, furious to see the man she
adores<br>
 duped by a villainous hussy; she would kill Valerie--"</p>

<p>"Oh, as for that," said the Brazilian, "that is my
business!"</p>

<p>"What, killing?" said old Nourrisson. "No, my son, we don't do
that<br>
 here nowadays."</p>

<p>"Oh!" said Montes, "I am not a native of this country. I live
in a<br>
 parish where I can laugh at your laws; and if you give me
proof--"</p>

<p>"Well, that note. Is that nothing?"</p>

<p>"No," said the Brazilian. "I do not believe in the writing. I
must see<br>
 for myself."</p>

<p>"See!" cried Carabine, taking the hint at once from a gesture
of her<br>
 supposed aunt. "You shall see, my dear Tiger, all you wish to
see--on<br>
 one condition."</p>

<p>"And that is?"</p>

<p>"Look at Cydalise."</p>

<p>At a wink from Madame Nourrisson, Cydalise cast a tender look
at the<br>
 Baron.</p>

<p>"Will you be good to her? Will you make her a home?" asked
Carabine.<br>
 "A girl of such beauty is well worth a house and a carriage! It
would<br>
 be a monstrous shame to leave her to walk the streets. And
besides--<br>
 she is in debt.--How much do you owe?" asked Carabine,
nipping<br>
 Cydalise's arm.</p>

<p>"She is worth all she can get," said the old woman. "The point
is that<br>
 she can find a buyer."</p>

<p>"Listen!" cried Montes, fully aware at last of this
masterpiece of<br>
 womankind "you will show me Valerie--"</p>

<p>"And Count Steinbock.--Certainly!" said Madame Nourrisson.</p>

<p>For the past ten minutes the old woman had been watching
the<br>
 Brazilian; she saw that he was an instrument tuned up to the
murderous<br>
 pitch she needed; and, above all, so effectually blinded, that
he<br>
 would never heed who had led him on to it, and she spoke:--</p>

<p>"Cydalise, my Brazilian jewel, is my niece, so her concerns
are partly<br>
 mine. All this catastrophe will be the work of a few minutes,
for a<br>
 friend of mine lets the furnished room to Count Steinbock
where<br>
 Valerie is at this moment taking coffee--a queer sort of coffee,
but<br>
 she calls it her coffee. So let us understand each other,
Brazil!--I<br>
 like Brazil, it is a hot country.--What is to become of my
niece?"</p>

<p>"You old ostrich," said Montes, the plumes in the woman's
bonnet<br>
 catching his eye, "you interrupted me.--If you show me--if I
see<br>
 Valerie and that artist together--"</p>

<p>"As you would wish to be--" said Carabine; "that is
understood."</p>

<p>"Then I will take this girl and carry her away--"</p>

<p>"Where?" asked Carabine.</p>

<p>"To Brazil," replied the Baron. "I will make her my wife. My
uncle<br>
 left me ten leagues square of entailed estate; that is how I
still<br>
 have that house and home. I have a hundred negroes--nothing
but<br>
 negroes and negresses and negro brats, all bought by my
uncle--"</p>

<p>"Nephew to a nigger-driver," said Carabine, with a grimace.
"That<br>
 needs some consideration.--Cydalise, child, are you fond of
the<br>
 blacks?"</p>

<p>"Pooh! Carabine, no nonsense," said the old woman. "The deuce
is in<br>
 it! Monsieur and I are doing business."</p>

<p>"If I take up another Frenchwoman, I mean to have her to
myself," the<br>
 Brazilian went on. "I warn you, mademoiselle, I am king there,
and not<br>
 a constitutional king. I am Czar; my subjects are mine by
purchase,<br>
 and no one can escape from my kingdom, which is a hundred
leagues from<br>
 any human settlement, hemmed in by savages on the interior,
and<br>
 divided from the sea by a wilderness as wide as France."</p>

<p>"I should prefer a garret here."</p>

<p>"So thought I," said Montes, "since I sold all my land and
possessions<br>
 at Rio to come back to Madame Marneffe."</p>

<p>"A man does not make such a voyage for nothing," remarked
Madame<br>
 Nourrisson. "You have a right to look for love for your own
sake,<br>
 particularly being so good-looking.--Oh, he is very handsome!"
said<br>
 she to Carabine.</p>

<p>"Very handsome, handsomer than the <i>Postillon de
Longjumeau,</i>" replied<br>
 the courtesan.</p>

<p>Cydalise took the Brazilian's hand, but he released it as
politely as<br>
 he could.</p>

<p>"I came back for Madame Marneffe," the man went on where he
had left<br>
 off, "but you do not know why I was three years thinking about
it."</p>

<p>"No, savage!" said Carabine.</p>

<p>"Well, she had so repeatedly told me that she longed to live
with me<br>
 alone in a desert--"</p>

<p>"Oh, ho! he is not a savage after all," cried Carabine, with a
shout<br>
 of laughter. "He is of the highly-civilized tribe of Flats!"</p>

<p>"She had told me this so often," Montes went on, regardless of
the<br>
 courtesan's mockery, "that I had a lovely house fitted up in the
heart<br>
 of that vast estate. I came back to France to fetch Valerie, and
the<br>
 first evening I saw her--"</p>

<p>"Saw her is very proper!" said Carabine. "I will remember
it."</p>

<p>"She told me to wait till that wretched Marneffe was dead; and
I<br>
 agreed, and forgave her for having admitted the attentions of
Hulot.<br>
 Whether the devil had her in hand I don't know, but from that
instant<br>
 that woman has humored my every whim, complied with all my
demands--<br>
 never for one moment has she given me cause to suspect
her!--"</p>

<p>"That is supremely clever!" said Carabine to Madame
Nourrisson, who<br>
 nodded in sign of assent.</p>

<p>"My faith in that woman," said Montes, and he shed a tear,
"was a<br>
 match for my love. Just now, I was ready to fight everybody
at<br>
 table--"</p>

<p>"So I saw," said Carabine.</p>

<p>"And if I am cheated, if she is going to be married, if she is
at this<br>
 moment in Steinbock's arms, she deserves a thousand deaths! I
will<br>
 kill her as I would smash a fly--"</p>

<p>"And how about the gendarmes, my son?" said Madame Nourrisson,
with a<br>
 smile that made your flesh creep.</p>

<p>"And the police agents, and the judges, and the assizes, and
all the<br>
 set-out?" added Carabine.</p>

<p>"You are bragging, my dear fellow," said the old woman, who
wanted to<br>
 know all the Brazilian's schemes of vengeance.</p>

<p>"I will kill her," he calmly repeated. "You called me a
savage.--Do<br>
 you imagine that I am fool enough to go, like a Frenchman, and
buy<br>
 poison at the chemist's shop?--During the time while we were
driving<br>
 her, I thought out my means of revenge, if you should prove to
be<br>
 right as concerns Valerie. One of my negroes has the most deadly
of<br>
 animal poisons, and incurable anywhere but in Brazil. I will<br>
 administer it to Cydalise, who will give it to me; then by the
time<br>
 when death is a certainty to Crevel and his wife, I shall be
beyond<br>
 the Azores with your cousin, who will be cured, and I will marry
her.<br>
 We have our own little tricks, we savages!--Cydalise," said
he,<br>
 looking at the country girl, "is the animal I need.--How much
does she<br>
 owe?"</p>

<p>"A hundred thousand francs," said Cydalise.</p>

<p>"She says little--but to the purpose," said Carabine, in a low
tone to<br>
 Madame Nourrisson.</p>

<p>"I am going mad!" cried the Brazilian, in a husky voice,
dropping on<br>
 to a sofa. "I shall die of this! But I must see, for it is
impossible!<br>
 --A lithographed note! What is to assure me that it is not a
forgery?<br>
 --Baron Hulot was in love with Valerie?" said he, recalling
Josepha's<br>
 harangue. "Nay; the proof that he did not love is that she is
still<br>
 alive--I will not leave her living for anybody else, if she is
not<br>
 wholly mine."</p>

<p>Montes was terrible to behold. He bellowed, he stormed; he
broke<br>
 everything he touched; rosewood was as brittle as glass.</p>

<p>"How he destroys things!" said Carabine, looking at the old
woman. "My<br>
 good boy," said she, giving the Brazilian a little slap, "Roland
the<br>
 Furious is very fine in a poem; but in a drawing-room he is
prosaic<br>
 and expensive."</p>

<p>"My son," said old Nourrisson, rising to stand in front of
the<br>
 crestfallen Baron, "I am of your way of thinking. When you love
in<br>
 that way, and are joined 'till death does you part,' life must
answer<br>
 for love. The one who first goes, carries everything away; it is
a<br>
 general wreck. You command my esteem, my admiration, my
consent,<br>
 especially for your inoculation, which will make me a Friend of
the<br>
 Negro.--But you love her! You will hark back?"</p>

<p>"I?--If she is so infamous, I--"</p>

<p>"Well, come now, you are talking too much, it strikes me. A
man who<br>
 means to be avenged, and who says he has the ways and means of
a<br>
 savage, doesn't do that.--If you want to see your 'object' in
her<br>
 paradise, you must take Cydalise and walk straight in with her
on your<br>
 arm, as if the servant had made a mistake. But no scandal! If
you mean<br>
 to be revenged, you must eat the leek, seem to be in despair,
and<br>
 allow her to bully you.--Do you see?" said Madame Nourrisson,
finding<br>
 the Brazilian quite amazed by so subtle a scheme.</p>

<p>"All right, old ostrich," he replied. "Come along: I
understand."</p>

<p>"Good-bye, little one!" said the old woman to Carabine.</p>

<p>She signed to Cydalise to go on with Montes, and remained a
minute<br>
 with Carabine.</p>

<p>"Now, child, I have but one fear, and that is that he will
strangle<br>
 her! I should be in a very tight place; we must do everything
gently.<br>
 I believe you have won your picture by Raphael; but they tell me
it is<br>
 only a Mignard. Never mind, it is much prettier; all the
Raphaels are<br>
 gone black, I am told, whereas this one is as bright as a
Girodet."</p>

<p>"All I want is to crow over Josepha; and it is all the same to
me<br>
 whether I have a Mignard or a Raphael!--That thief had on such
pearls<br>
 this evening!--you would sell your soul for them."</p>

<p>Cydalise, Montes, and Madame Nourrisson got into a hackney
coach that<br>
 was waiting at the door. Madame Nourrisson whispered to the
driver the<br>
 address of a house in the same block as the Italian Opera House,
which<br>
 they could have reached in five or six minutes from the Rue
Saint-<br>
 Georges; but Madame Nourrisson desired the man to drive along
the Rue<br>
 le Peletier, and to go very slowly, so as to be able to examine
the<br>
 carriages in waiting.</p>

<p>"Brazilian," said the old woman, "look out for your angel's
carriage<br>
 and servants."</p>

<p>The Baron pointed out Valerie's carriage as they passed
it.</p>

<p>"She has told them to come for her at ten o'clock, and she is
gone in<br>
 a cab to the house where she visits Count Steinbock. She has
dined<br>
 there, and will come to the Opera in half an hour.--It is
well<br>
 contrived!" said Madame Nourrisson. "Thus you see how she has
kept you<br>
 so long in the dark."</p>

<p>The Brazilian made no reply. He had become the tiger, and
had<br>
 recovered the imperturbable cool ferocity that had been so
striking at<br>
 dinner. He was as calm as a bankrupt the day after he has
stopped<br>
 payment.</p>

<p>At the door of the house stood a hackney coach with two
horses, of the<br>
 kind known as a <i>Compagnie Generale</i>, from the Company that
runs them.</p>

<p>"Stay here in the box," said the old woman to Montes. "This is
not an<br>
 open house like a tavern. I will send for you."</p>

<p>The paradise of Madame Marneffe and Wenceslas was not at all
like that<br>
 of Crevel--who, finding it useless now, had just sold his to the
Comte<br>
 Maxime de Trailles. This paradise, the paradise of all
comers,<br>
 consisted of a room on the fourth floor opening to the landing,
in a<br>
 house close to the Italian Opera. On each floor of this house
there<br>
 was a room which had originally served as the kitchen to the<br>
 apartments on that floor. But the house having become a sort of
inn,<br>
 let out for clandestine love affairs at an exorbitant price,
the<br>
 owner, the real Madame Nourrisson, an old-clothes buyer in the
Rue<br>
 Nueve Saint-Marc, had wisely appreciated the great value of
these<br>
 kitchens, and had turned them into a sort of dining-rooms. Each
of<br>
 these rooms, built between thick party-walls and with windows to
the<br>
 street, was entirely shut in by very thick double doors on
the<br>
 landing. Thus the most important secrets could be discussed over
a<br>
 dinner, with no risk of being overheard. For greater security,
the<br>
 windows had shutters inside and out. These rooms, in consequence
of<br>
 this peculiarity, were let for twelve hundred francs a month.
The<br>
 whole house, full of such paradises and mysteries was rented by
Madame<br>
 Nourrisson the First for twenty-eight thousand francs of clear
profit,<br>
 after paying her housekeeper, Madame Nourrisson the Second, for
she<br>
 did not manage it herself.</p>

<p><br>
 The paradise let to Count Steinbock had been hung with chintz;
the<br>
 cold, hard floor, of common tiles reddened with encaustic, was
not<br>
 felt through a soft thick carpet. The furniture consisted of
two<br>
 pretty chairs and a bed in an alcove, just now half hidden by a
table<br>
 loaded with the remains of an elegant dinner, while two bottles
with<br>
 long necks and an empty champagne-bottle in ice strewed the
field of<br>
 bacchus cultivated by Venus.</p>

<p>There were also--the property, no doubt, of Valerie--a low
easy-chair<br>
 and a man's smoking-chair, and a pretty toilet chest of drawers
in<br>
 rosewood, the mirror handsomely framed <i>a la</i> Pompadour. A
lamp<br>
 hanging from the ceiling gave a subdued light, increased by
wax<br>
 candles on the table and on the chimney-shelf.</p>

<p>This sketch will suffice to give an idea, <i>urbi et orbi</i>,
of<br>
 clandestine passion in the squalid style stamped on it in Paris
in<br>
 1840. How far, alas! from the adulterous love, symbolized by
Vulcan's<br>
 nets, three thousand years ago.</p>

<p>When Montes and Cydalise came upstairs, Valerie, standing
before the<br>
 fire, where a log was blazing, was allowing Wenceslas to lace
her<br>
 stays.</p>

<p>This is a moment when a woman who is neither too fat nor too
thin, but<br>
 like Valerie, elegant and slender, displays divine beauty. The
rosy<br>
 skin, mostly soft, invites the sleepiest eye. The lines of her
figure,<br>
 so little hidden, are so charmingly outlined by the white pleats
of<br>
 the shift and the support of the stays, that she is
irresistible--like<br>
 everything that must be parted from.</p>

<p>With a happy face smiling at the glass, a foot impatiently
marking<br>
 time, a hand put up to restore order among the tumbled curls,
and eyes<br>
 expressive of gratitude; with the glow of satisfaction which,
like a<br>
 sunset, warms the least details of the countenance--everything
makes<br>
 such a moment a mine of memories.</p>

<p>Any man who dares look back on the early errors of his life
may,<br>
 perhaps, recall some such reminiscences, and understand, though
not<br>
 excuse, the follies of Hulot and Crevel. Women are so well aware
of<br>
 their power at such a moment, that they find in it what may be
called<br>
 the aftermath of the meeting.</p>

<p>"Come, come; after two years' practice, you do not yet know
how to<br>
 lace a woman's stays! You are too much a Pole!--There, it is
ten<br>
 o'clock, my Wenceslas!" said Valerie, laughing at him.</p>

<p>At this very moment, a mischievous waiting-woman, by inserting
a<br>
 knife, pushed up the hook of the double doors that formed the
whole<br>
 security of Adam and Eve. She hastily pulled the door open--for
the<br>
 servants of these dens have little time to waste--and discovered
one<br>
 of the bewitching <i>tableaux de genre</i> which Gavarni has so
often shown<br>
 at the Salon.</p>

<p>"In here, madame," said the girl; and Cydalise went in,
followed by<br>
 Montes.</p>

<p>"But there is some one here.--Excuse me, madame," said the
country<br>
 girl, in alarm.</p>

<p>"What?--Why! it is Valerie!" cried Montes, violently slamming
the<br>
 door.</p>

<p>Madame Marneffe, too genuinely agitated to dissemble her
feelings,<br>
 dropped on to the chair by the fireplace. Two tears rose to her
eyes,<br>
 and at once dried away. She looked at Montes, saw the girl, and
burst<br>
 into a cackle of forced laughter. The dignity of the insulted
woman<br>
 redeemed the scantiness of her attire; she walked close up to
the<br>
 Brazilian, and looked at him so defiantly that her eyes
glittered like<br>
 knives.</p>

<p>"So that," said she, standing face to face with the Baron,
and<br>
 pointing to Cydalise--"that is the other side of your fidelity?
You,<br>
 who have made me promises that might convert a disbeliever in
love!<br>
 You, for whom I have done so much--have even committed
crimes!--You<br>
 are right, monsieur, I am not to compare with a child of her age
and<br>
 of such beauty!</p>

<p>"I know what you are going to say," she went on, looking at
Wenceslas,<br>
 whose undress was proof too clear to be denied. "This is my
concern.<br>
 If I could love you after such gross treachery--for you have
spied<br>
 upon me, you have paid for every step up these stairs, paid
the<br>
 mistress of the house, and the servant, perhaps even Reine--a
noble<br>
 deed!--If I had any remnant of affection for such a mean wretch,
I<br>
 could give him reasons that would renew his passion!--But I
leave you,<br>
 monsieur, to your doubts, which will become remorse.--Wenceslas,
my<br>
 gown!"</p>

<p>She took her dress and put it on, looked at herself in the
glass, and<br>
 finished dressing without heeding the Baron, as calmly as if she
had<br>
 been alone in the room.</p>

<p>"Wenceslas, are you ready?--Go first."</p>

<p>She had been watching Montes in the glass and out of the
corner of her<br>
 eye, and fancied she could see in his pallor an indication of
the<br>
 weakness which delivers a strong man over to a woman's
fascinations;<br>
 she now took his hand, going so close to him that he could not
help<br>
 inhaling the terrible perfumes which men love, and by which
they<br>
 intoxicate themselves; then, feeling his pulses beat high, she
looked<br>
 at him reproachfully.</p>

<p>"You have my full permission to go and tell your history to
Monsieur<br>
 Crevel; he will never believe you. I have a perfect right to
marry<br>
 him, and he becomes my husband the day after to-morrow.--I shall
make<br>
 him very happy.--Good-bye; try to forget me."</p>

<p>"Oh! Valerie," cried Henri Montes, clasping her in his arms,
"that is<br>
 impossible!--Come to Brazil!"</p>

<p>Valerie looked in his face, and saw him her slave.</p>

<p>"Well, if you still love me, Henri, two years hence I will be
your<br>
 wife; but your expression at this moment strikes me as very<br>
 suspicious."</p>

<p>"I swear to you that they made me drink, that false friends
threw this<br>
 girl on my hands, and that the whole thing is the outcome of
chance!"<br>
 said Montes.</p>

<p>"Then I am to forgive you?" she asked, with a smile.</p>

<p>"But you will marry, all the same?" asked the Baron, in an
agony of<br>
 jealousy.</p>

<p>"Eighty thousand francs a year!" said she, with almost
comical<br>
 enthusiasm. "And Crevel loves me so much that he will die of
it!"</p>

<p>"Ah! I understand," said Montes.</p>

<p>"Well, then, in a few days we will come to an understanding,"
said<br>
 she.</p>

<p>And she departed triumphant.</p>

<p>"I have no scruples," thought the Baron, standing transfixed
for a few<br>
 minutes. "What! That woman believes she can make use of his
passion to<br>
 be quit of that dolt, as she counted on Marneffe's decease!--I
shall<br>
 be the instrument of divine wrath."</p>

<p>Two days later those of du Tillet's guests who had demolished
Madame<br>
 Marneffe tooth and nail, were seated round her table an hour
after she<br>
 has shed her skin and changed her name for the illustrious name
of a<br>
 Paris mayor. This verbal treason is one of the commonest forms
of<br>
 Parisian levity.</p>

<p>Valerie had had the satisfaction of seeing the Brazilian in
the<br>
 church; for Crevel, now so entirely the husband, had invited him
out<br>
 of bravado. And the Baron's presence at the breakfast astonished
no<br>
 one. All these men of wit and of the world were familiar with
the<br>
 meanness of passion, the compromises of pleasure.</p>

<p>Steinbock's deep melancholy--for he was beginning to despise
the woman<br>
 whom he had adored as an angel--was considered to be in
excellent<br>
 taste. The Pole thus seemed to convey that all was at an end
between<br>
 Valerie and himself. Lisbeth came to embrace her dear Madame
Crevel,<br>
 and to excuse herself for not staying to the breakfast on the
score of<br>
 Adeline's sad state of health.</p>

<p>"Be quite easy," said she to Valerie, "they will call on you,
and you<br>
 will call on them. Simply hearing the words <i>two hundred
thousand<br>
 francs</i> has brought the Baroness to death's door. Oh, you
have them<br>
 all hard and fast by that tale!--But you must tell it to
me."</p>

<p>Within a month of her marriage, Valerie was at her tenth
quarrel with<br>
 Steinbock; he insisted on explanations as to Henri Montes,
reminding<br>
 her of the words spoken in their paradise; and, not content
with<br>
 speaking to her in terms of scorn, he watched her so closely
that she<br>
 never had a moment of liberty, so much was she fettered by
his<br>
 jealousy on one side and Crevel's devotion on the other.</p>

<p>Bereft now of Lisbeth, whose advice had always been so
valuable she<br>
 flew into such a rage as to reproach Wenceslas for the money she
had<br>
 lent him. This so effectually roused Steinbock's pride, that he
came<br>
 no more to the Crevels' house. So Valerie had gained her point,
which<br>
 was to be rid of him for a time, and enjoy some freedom. She
waited<br>
 till Crevel should make a little journey into the country to see
Comte<br>
 Popinot, with a view to arranging for her introduction to
the<br>
 Countess, and was then able to make an appointment to meet the
Baron,<br>
 whom she wanted to have at her command for a whole day to give
him<br>
 those "reasons" which were to make him love her more than
ever.</p>

<p>On the morning of that day, Reine, who estimated the magnitude
of her<br>
 crime by that of the bribe she received, tried to warn her
mistress,<br>
 in whom she naturally took more interest than in strangers.
Still, as<br>
 she had been threatened with madness, and ending her days in
the<br>
 Salpetriere in case of indiscretion, she was cautious.</p>

<p>"Madame, you are so well off now," said she. "Why take on
again with<br>
 that Brazilian?--I do not trust him at all."</p>

<p>"You are very right, Reine, and I mean to be rid of him."</p>

<p>"Oh, madame, I am glad to hear it; he frightens me, does that
big<br>
 Moor! I believe him to be capable of anything."</p>

<p>"Silly child! you have more reason to be afraid for him when
he is<br>
 with me."</p>

<p>At this moment Lisbeth came in.</p>

<p>"My dear little pet Nanny, what an age since we met!" cried
Valerie.<br>
 "I am so unhappy! Crevel bores me to death; and Wenceslas is
gone--we<br>
 quarreled."</p>

<p>"I know," said Lisbeth, "and that is what brings me here.
Victorin met<br>
 him at about five in the afternoon going into an eating-house at
five-<br>
 and-twenty sous, and he brought him home, hungry, by working on
his<br>
 feelings, to the Rue Louis-le-Grand.--Hortense, seeing Wenceslas
lean<br>
 and ill and badly dressed, held out her hand. This is how you
throw me<br>
 over--"</p>

<p>"Monsieur Henri, madame," the man-servant announced in a low
voice to<br>
 Valerie.</p>

<p>"Leave me now, Lisbeth; I will explain it all to-morrow." But,
as will<br>
 be seen, Valerie was ere long not in a state to explain anything
to<br>
 anybody.</p>

<p>Towards the end of May, Baron Hulot's pension was released
by<br>
 Victorin's regular payment to Baron Nucingen. As everybody
knows,<br>
 pensions are paid half-yearly, and only on the presentation of
a<br>
 certificate that the recipient is alive: and as Hulot's
residence was<br>
 unknown, the arrears unpaid on Vauvinet's demand remained to
his<br>
 credit in the Treasury. Vauvinet now signed his renunciation of
any<br>
 further claims, and it was still indispensable to find the
pensioner<br>
 before the arrears could be drawn.</p>

<p>Thanks to Bianchon's care, the Baroness had recovered her
health; and<br>
 to this Josepha's good heart had contributed by a letter, of
which the<br>
 orthography betrayed the collaboration of the Duc d'Herouville.
This<br>
 was what the singer wrote to the Baroness, after twenty days
of<br>
 anxious search:--</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"MADAME LA BARONNE,--Monsieur Hulot was living, two months
since,<br>
 in the Rue des Bernardins, with Elodie Chardin, a lace-mender,
for<br>
 whom he had left Mademoiselle Bijou; but he went away without
a<br>
 word, leaving everything behind him, and no one knows where
he<br>
 went. I am not without hope, however, and I have put a man on
this<br>
 track who believes he has already seen him in the Boulevard<br>
 Bourdon.</p>

<p>"The poor Jewess means to keep the promise she made to the<br>
 Christian. Will the angel pray for the devil? That must
sometimes<br>
 happen in heaven.--I remain, with the deepest respect, always
your<br>
 humble servant,</p>

<p><br>
 "JOSEPHA MIRAH."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The lawyer, Maitre Hulot d'Ervy, hearing no more of the
dreadful<br>
 Madame Nourrisson, seeing his father-in-law married, having
brought<br>
 back his brother-in-law to the family fold, suffering from
no<br>
 importunity on the part of his new stepmother, and seeing his
mother's<br>
 health improve daily, gave himself up to his political and
judicial<br>
 duties, swept along by the tide of Paris life, in which the
hours<br>
 count for days.</p>

<p><br>
 One night, towards the end of the session, having occasion to
write up<br>
 a report to the Chamber of Deputies, he was obliged to sit at
work<br>
 till late at night. He had gone into his study at nine o'clock,
and,<br>
 while waiting till the man-servant should bring in the candles
with<br>
 green shades, his thoughts turned to his father. He was
blaming<br>
 himself for leaving the inquiry so much to the singer, and
had<br>
 resolved to see Monsieur Chapuzot himself on the morrow, when he
saw<br>
 in the twilight, outside the window, a handsome old head, bald
and<br>
 yellow, with a fringe of white hair.</p>

<p>"Would you please to give orders, sir, that a poor hermit is
to be<br>
 admitted, just come from the Desert, and who is instructed to
beg for<br>
 contributions towards rebuilding a holy house."</p>

<p>This apparition, which suddenly reminded the lawyer of a
prophecy<br>
 uttered by the terrible Nourrisson, gave him a shock.</p>

<p>"Let in that old man," said he to the servant.</p>

<p>"He will poison the place, sir," replied the man. "He has on a
brown<br>
 gown which he has never changed since he left Syria, and he has
no<br>
 shirt--"</p>

<p>"Show him in," repeated the master.</p>

<p>The old man came in. Victorin's keen eye examined this
so-called<br>
 pilgrim hermit, and he saw a fine specimen of the Neapolitan
friars,<br>
 whose frocks are akin to the rags of the <i>lazzaroni</i>, whose
sandals<br>
 are tatters of leather, as the friars are tatters of humanity.
The<br>
 get-up was so perfect that the lawyer, though still on his
guard, was<br>
 vexed with himself for having believed it to be one of
Madame<br>
 Nourrisson's tricks.</p>

<p>"How much to you want of me?"</p>

<p>"Whatever you feel that you ought to give me."</p>

<p>Victorin took a five-franc piece from a little pile on his
table, and<br>
 handed it to the stranger.</p>

<p>"That is not much on account of fifty thousand francs," said
the<br>
 pilgrim of the desert.</p>

<p>This speech removed all Victorin's doubts.</p>

<p>"And has Heaven kept its word?" he said, with a frown.</p>

<p>"The question is an offence, my son," said the hermit. "If you
do not<br>
 choose to pay till after the funeral, you are in your rights. I
will<br>
 return in a week's time."</p>

<p>"The funeral!" cried the lawyer, starting up.</p>

<p>"The world moves on," said the old man, as he withdrew, "and
the dead<br>
 move quickly in Paris!"</p>

<p>When Hulot, who stood looking down, was about to reply, the
stalwart<br>
 old man had vanished.</p>

<p>"I don't understand one word of all this," said Victorin to
himself.<br>
 "But at the end of the week I will ask him again about my
father, if<br>
 we have not yet found him. Where does Madame Nourrisson--yes,
that was<br>
 her name--pick up such actors?"</p>

<p>On the following day, Doctor Bianchon allowed the Baroness to
go down<br>
 into the garden, after examining Lisbeth, who had been obliged
to keep<br>
 to her room for a month by a slight bronchial attack. The
learned<br>
 doctor, who dared not pronounce a definite opinion on Lisbeth's
case<br>
 till he had seen some decisive symptoms, went into the garden
with<br>
 Adeline to observe the effect of the fresh air on her
nervous<br>
 trembling after two months of seclusion. He was interested and
allured<br>
 by the hope of curing this nervous complaint. On seeing the
great<br>
 physician sitting with them and sparing them a few minutes,
the<br>
 Baroness and her family conversed with him on general
subjects.</p>

<p>"You life is a very full and a very sad one," said Madame
Hulot. "I<br>
 know what it is to spend one's days in seeing poverty and
physical<br>
 suffering."</p>

<p>"I know, madame," replied the doctor, "all the scenes of which
charity<br>
 compels you to be a spectator; but you will get used to it in
time, as<br>
 we all do. It is the law of existence. The confessor, the
magistrate,<br>
 the lawyer would find life unendurable if the spirit of the
State did<br>
 not assert itself above the feelings of the individual. Could we
live<br>
 at all but for that? Is not the soldier in time of war brought
face to<br>
 face with spectacles even more dreadful than those we see? And
every<br>
 soldier that has been under fire is kind-hearted. We medical men
have<br>
 the pleasure now and again of a successful cure, as you have
that of<br>
 saving a family from the horrors of hunger, depravity, or
misery, and<br>
 of restoring it to social respectability. But what comfort can
the<br>
 magistrate find, the police agent, or the attorney, who spend
their<br>
 lives in investigating the basest schemes of self-interest, the
social<br>
 monster whose only regret is when it fails, but on whom
repentance<br>
 never dawns?</p>

<p>"One-half of society spends its life in watching the other
half. A<br>
 very old friend of mine is an attorney, now retired, who told me
that<br>
 for fifteen years past notaries and lawyers have distrusted
their<br>
 clients quite as much as their adversaries. Your son is a
pleader; has<br>
 he never found himself compromised by the client for whom he
held a<br>
 brief?"</p>

<p>"Very often," said Victorin, with a smile.</p>

<p>"And what is the cause of this deep-seated evil?" asked the
Baroness.</p>

<p>"The decay of religion," said Bianchon, "and the pre-eminence
of<br>
 finance, which is simply solidified selfishness. Money used not
to be<br>
 everything; there were some kinds of superiority that ranked
above it<br>
 --nobility, genius, service done to the State. But nowadays the
law<br>
 takes wealth as the universal standard, and regards it as the
measure<br>
 of public capacity. Certain magistrates are ineligible to the
Chamber;<br>
 Jean-Jacques Rousseau would be ineligible! The perpetual
subdivision<br>
 of estate compels every man to take care of himself from the age
of<br>
 twenty.</p>

<p>"Well, then, between the necessity for making a fortune and
the<br>
 depravity of speculation there is no check or hindrance; for
the<br>
 religious sense is wholly lacking in France, in spite of the
laudable<br>
 endeavors of those who are working for a Catholic revival. And
this is<br>
 the opinion of every man who, like me, studies society at the
core."</p>

<p>"And you have few pleasures?" said Hortense.</p>

<p>"The true physician, madame, is in love with his science,"
replied the<br>
 doctor. "He is sustained by that passion as much as by the sense
of<br>
 his usefulness to society.</p>

<p>"At this very time you see in me a sort of scientific rapture,
and<br>
 many superficial judges would regard me as a man devoid of
feeling. I<br>
 have to announce a discovery to-morrow to the College of
Medicine, for<br>
 I am studying a disease that had disappeared--a mortal disease
for<br>
 which no cure is known in temperate climates, though it is
curable in<br>
 the West Indies--a malady known here in the Middle Ages. A noble
fight<br>
 is that of the physician against such a disease. For the last
ten days<br>
 I have thought of nothing but these cases--for there are two,
a<br>
 husband and wife.--Are they not connections of yours? For you,
madame,<br>
 are surely Monsieur Crevel's daughter?" said he, addressing
Celestine.</p>

<p>"What, is my father your patient?" asked Celestine. "Living in
the Rue<br>
 Barbet-de-Jouy?"</p>

<p>"Precisely so," said Bianchon.</p>

<p>"And the disease is inevitably fatal?" said Victorin in
dismay.</p>

<p>"I will go to see him," said Celestine, rising.</p>

<p>"I positively forbid it, madame," Bianchon quietly said. "The
disease<br>
 is contagious."</p>

<p>"But you go there, monsieur," replied the young woman. "Do you
think<br>
 that a daughter's duty is less binding than a doctor's?"</p>

<p>"Madame, a physician knows how to protect himself against
infection,<br>
 and the rashness of your devotion proves to me that you would
probably<br>
 be less prudent than I."</p>

<p>Celestine, however, got up and went to her room, where she
dressed to<br>
 go out.</p>

<p>"Monsieur," said Victorin to Bianchon, "have you any hope of
saving<br>
 Monsieur and Madame Crevel?"</p>

<p>"I hope, but I do not believe that I may," said Bianchon. "The
case is<br>
 to me quite inexplicable. The disease is peculiar to negroes and
the<br>
 American tribes, whose skin is differently constituted to that
of the<br>
 white races. Now I can trace no connection with the
copper-colored<br>
 tribes, with negroes or half-castes, in Monsieur or Madame
Crevel.</p>

<p>"And though it is a very interesting disease to us, it is a
terrible<br>
 thing for the sufferers. The poor woman, who is said to have
been very<br>
 pretty, is punished for her sins, for she is now squalidly
hideous if<br>
 she is still anything at all. She is losing her hair and teeth,
her<br>
 skin is like a leper's, she is a horror to herself; her hands
are<br>
 horrible, covered with greenish pustules, her nails are loose,
and the<br>
 flesh is eaten away by the poisoned humors."</p>

<p>"And the cause of such a disease?" asked the lawyer.</p>

<p>"Oh!" said the doctor, "the cause lies in a form of rapid
blood-<br>
 poisoning; it degenerates with terrific rapidity. I hope to act
on the<br>
 blood; I am having it analyzed; and I am now going home to
ascertain<br>
 the result of the labors of my friend Professor Duval, the
famous<br>
 chemist, with a view to trying one of those desperate measures
by<br>
 which we sometimes attempt to defeat death."</p>

<p>"The hand of God is there!" said Adeline, in a voice husky
with<br>
 emotion. "Though that woman has brought sorrows on me which have
led<br>
 me in moments of madness to invoke the vengeance of Heaven, I
hope--<br>
 God knows I hope--you may succeed, doctor."</p>

<p>Victorin felt dizzy. He looked at his mother, his sister, and
the<br>
 physician by turns, quaking lest they should read his thoughts.
He<br>
 felt himself a murderer.</p>

<p>Hortense, for her part, thought God was just.</p>

<p>Celestine came back to beg her husband to accompany her.</p>

<p>"If you insist on going, madame, and you too, monsieur, keep
at least<br>
 a foot between you and the bed of the sufferer, that is the
chief<br>
 precaution. Neither you nor your wife must dream of kissing the
dying<br>
 man. And, indeed, you ought to go with your wife, Monsieur
Hulot, to<br>
 hinder her from disobeying my injunctions."</p>

<p>Adeline and Hortense, when they were left alone, went to sit
with<br>
 Lisbeth. Hortense had such a virulent hatred of Valerie that she
could<br>
 not contain the expression of it.</p>

<p>"Cousin Lisbeth," she exclaimed, "my mother and I are avenged!
that<br>
 venomous snake is herself bitten--she is rotting in her
bed!"</p>

<p>"Hortense, at this moment you are not a Christian. You ought
to pray<br>
 to God to vouchsafe repentance to this wretched woman."</p>

<p>"What are you talking about?" said Betty, rising from her
couch. "Are<br>
 you speaking of Valerie?"</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Adeline; "she is past hope--dying of some
horrible<br>
 disease of which the mere description makes one shudder----"</p>

<p>Lisbeth's teeth chattered, a cold sweat broke out all over
her; the<br>
 violence of the shock showed how passionate her attachment to
Valerie<br>
 had been.</p>

<p>"I must go there," said she.</p>

<p>"But the doctor forbids your going out."</p>

<p>"I do not care--I must go!--Poor Crevel! what a state he must
be in;<br>
 for he loves that woman."</p>

<p>"He is dying too," replied Countess Steinbock. "Ah! all our
enemies<br>
 are in the devil's clutches--"</p>

<p>"In God's hands, my child--"</p>

<p>Lisbeth dressed in the famous yellow Indian shawl and her
black velvet<br>
 bonnet, and put on her boots; in spite of her relations'<br>
 remonstrances, she set out as if driven by some irresistible
power.</p>

<p>She arrived in the Rue Barbet a few minutes after Monsieur and
Madame<br>
 Hulot, and found seven physicians there, brought by Bianchon to
study<br>
 this unique case; he had just joined them. The physicians,
assembled<br>
 in the drawing-room, were discussing the disease; now one and
now<br>
 another went into Valerie's room or Crevel's to take a note,
and<br>
 returned with an opinion based on this rapid study.</p>

<p><br>
 These princes of science were divided in their opinions. One,
who<br>
 stood alone in his views, considered it a case of poisoning,
of<br>
 private revenge, and denied its identity with the disease known
in the<br>
 Middle Ages. Three others regarded it as a specific
deterioration of<br>
 the blood and the humors. The rest, agreeing with Bianchon,
maintained<br>
 that the blood was poisoned by some hitherto unknown morbid
infection.<br>
 Bianchon produced Professor Duval's analysis of the blood.
The<br>
 remedies to be applied, though absolutely empirical and without
hope,<br>
 depended on the verdict in this medical dilemma.</p>

<p>Lisbeth stood as if petrified three yards away from the bed
where<br>
 Valerie lay dying, as she saw a priest from Saint-Thomas
d'Aquin<br>
 standing by her friend's pillow, and a sister of charity in<br>
 attendance. Religion could find a soul to save in a mass of
rottenness<br>
 which, of the five senses of man, had now only that of sight.
The<br>
 sister of charity who alone had been found to nurse Valerie
stood<br>
 apart. Thus the Catholic religion, that divine institution,
always<br>
 actuated by the spirit of self-sacrifice, under its twofold
aspect of<br>
 the Spirit and the Flesh, was tending this horrible and
atrocious<br>
 creature, soothing her death-bed by its infinite benevolence
and<br>
 inexhaustible stores of mercy.</p>

<p>The servants, in horror, refused to go into the room of either
their<br>
 master or mistress; they thought only of themselves, and judged
their<br>
 betters as righteously stricken. The smell was so foul that in
spite<br>
 of open windows and strong perfumes, no one could remain long
in<br>
 Valerie's room. Religion alone kept guard there.</p>

<p>How could a woman so clever as Valerie fail to ask herself to
what end<br>
 these two representatives of the Church remained with her? The
dying<br>
 woman had listened to the words of the priest. Repentance had
risen on<br>
 her darkened soul as the devouring malady had consumed her
beauty. The<br>
 fragile Valerie had been less able to resist the inroads of
the<br>
 disease than Crevel; she would be the first to succumb, and,
indeed,<br>
 had been the first attacked.</p>

<p>"If I had not been ill myself, I would have come to nurse
you," said<br>
 Lisbeth at last, after a glance at her friend's sunken eyes. "I
have<br>
 kept my room this fortnight or three weeks; but when I heard of
your<br>
 state from the doctor, I came at once."</p>

<p>"Poor Lisbeth, you at least love me still, I see!" said
Valerie.<br>
 "Listen. I have only a day or two left to think, for I cannot
say to<br>
 live. You see, there is nothing left of me--I am a heap of mud!
They<br>
 will not let me see myself in a glass.--Well, it is no more than
I<br>
 deserve. Oh, if I might only win mercy, I would gladly undo all
the<br>
 mischief I have done."</p>

<p>"Oh!" said Lisbeth, "if you can talk like that, you are indeed
a dead<br>
 woman."</p>

<p>"Do not hinder this woman's repentance, leave her in her
Christian<br>
 mind," said the priest.</p>

<p>"There is nothing left!" said Lisbeth in consternation. "I
cannot<br>
 recognize her eyes or her mouth! Not a feature of her is there!
And<br>
 her wit has deserted her! Oh, it is awful!"</p>

<p>"You don't know," said Valerie, "what death is; what it is to
be<br>
 obliged to think of the morrow of your last day on earth, and of
what<br>
 is to be found in the grave.--Worms for the body--and for the
soul,<br>
 what?--Lisbeth, I know there is another life! And I am given
over to<br>
 terrors which prevent my feeling the pangs of my decomposing
body.--I,<br>
 who could laugh at a saint, and say to Crevel that the vengeance
of<br>
 God took every form of disaster.-- Well, I was a true
prophet.--Do not<br>
 trifle with sacred things, Lisbeth; if you love me, repent as I
do."</p>

<p>"I!" said Lisbeth. "I see vengeance wherever I turn in nature;
insects<br>
 even die to satisfy the craving for revenge when they are
attacked.<br>
 And do not these gentlemen tell us"--and she looked at the
priest--<br>
 "that God is revenged, and that His vengeance lasts through
all<br>
 eternity?"</p>

<p>The priest looked mildly at Lisbeth and said:</p>

<p>"You, madame, are an atheist!"</p>

<p>"But look what I have come to," said Valerie.</p>

<p>"And where did you get this gangrene?" asked the old maid,
unmoved<br>
 from her peasant incredulity.</p>

<p>"I had a letter from Henri which leaves me in no doubt as to
my fate.<br>
 He has murdered me. And--just when I meant to live honestly--to
die an<br>
 object of disgust!</p>

<p>"Lisbeth, give up all notions of revenge. Be kind to that
family to<br>
 whom I have left by my will everything I can dispose of. Go,
child,<br>
 though you are the only creature who, at this hour, does not
avoid me<br>
 with horror--go, I beseech you, and leave me.--I have only time
to<br>
 make my peace with God!"</p>

<p>"She is wandering in her wits," said Lisbeth to herself, as
she left<br>
 the room.</p>

<p>The strongest affection known, that of a woman for a woman,
had not<br>
 such heroic constancy as the Church. Lisbeth, stifled by the
miasma,<br>
 went away. She found the physicians still in consultation.
But<br>
 Bianchon's opinion carried the day, and the only question now
was how<br>
 to try the remedies.</p>

<p>"At any rate, we shall have a splendid <i>post-mortem</i>,"
said one of his<br>
 opponents, "and there will be two cases to enable us to make<br>
 comparisons."</p>

<p>Lisbeth went in again with Bianchon, who went up to the sick
woman<br>
 without seeming aware of the malodorous atmosphere.</p>

<p>"Madame," said he, "we intend to try a powerful remedy which
may save<br>
 you--"</p>

<p>"And if you save my life," said she, "shall I be as
good-looking as<br>
 ever?"</p>

<p>"Possibly," said the judicious physician.</p>

<p>"I know your <i>possibly</i>," said Valerie. "I shall look
like a woman who<br>
 has fallen into the fire! No, leave me to the Church. I can
please no<br>
 one now but God. I will try to be reconciled to Him, and that
will be<br>
 my last flirtation; yes, I must try to come round God!"</p>

<p>"That is my poor Valerie's last jest; that is all herself!"
said<br>
 Lisbeth in tears.</p>

<p>Lisbeth thought it her duty to go into Crevel's room, where
she found<br>
 Victorin and his wife sitting about a yard away from the
stricken<br>
 man's bed.</p>

<p>"Lisbeth," said he, "they will not tell me what state my wife
is in;<br>
 you have just seen her--how is she?"</p>

<p>"She is better; she says she is saved," replied Lisbeth,
allowing<br>
 herself this play on the word to soothe Crevel's mind.</p>

<p>"That is well," said the Mayor. "I feared lest I had been the
cause of<br>
 her illness. A man is not a traveler in perfumery for nothing; I
had<br>
 blamed myself.--If I should lose her, what would become of me?
On my<br>
 honor, my children, I worship that woman."</p>

<p>He sat up in bed and tried to assume his favorite
position.</p>

<p>"Oh, Papa!" cried Celestine, "if only you could be well again,
I would<br>
 make friends with my stepmother--I make a vow!"</p>

<p>"Poor little Celestine!" said Crevel, "come and kiss me."</p>

<p>Victorin held back his wife, who was rushing forward.</p>

<p>"You do not know, perhaps," said the lawyer gently, "that your
disease<br>
 is contagious, monsieur."</p>

<p>"To be sure," replied Crevel. "And the doctors are quite proud
of<br>
 having rediscovered in me some long lost plague of the Middle
Ages,<br>
 which the Faculty has had cried like lost property--it is very
funny!"</p>

<p>"Papa," said Celestine, "be brave, and you will get the better
of this<br>
 disease."</p>

<p>"Be quite easy, my children; Death thinks twice of it before
carrying<br>
 off a Mayor of Paris," said he, with monstrous composure. "And
if,<br>
 after all, my district is so unfortunate as to lose a man it has
twice<br>
 honored with its suffrages--you see, what a flow of words I
have!--<br>
 Well, I shall know how to pack up and go. I have been a
commercial<br>
 traveler; I am experienced in such matters. Ah! my children, I
am a<br>
 man of strong mind."</p>

<p>"Papa, promise me to admit the Church--"</p>

<p>"Never," replied Crevel. "What is to be said? I drank the milk
of<br>
 Revolution; I have not Baron Holbach's wit, but I have his
strength of<br>
 mind. I am more <i>Regence</i> than ever, more Musketeer, Abbe
Dubois, and<br>
 Marechal de Richelieu! By the Holy Poker!--My wife, who is
wandering<br>
 in her head, has just sent me a man in a gown--to me! the
admirer of<br>
 Beranger, the friend of Lisette, the son of Voltaire and
Rousseau.--<br>
 The doctor, to feel my pulse, as it were, and see if sickness
had<br>
 subdued me--'You saw Monsieur l'Abbe?' said he.--Well, I
imitated the<br>
 great Montesquieu. Yes, I looked at the doctor--see, like this,"
and<br>
 he turned to show three-quarters face, like his portrait, and
extended<br>
 his hand authoritatively--"and I said:</p>

<p>"The slave was here,<br>
 He showed his order, but he nothing gained.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><i>"His order</i> is a pretty jest, showing that even in death
Monsieur le<br>
 President de Montesquieu preserved his elegant wit, for they had
sent<br>
 him a Jesuit. I admire that passage--I cannot say of his life,
but of<br>
 his death--the passage--another joke!--The passage from life to
death<br>
 --the Passage Montesquieu!"</p>

<p><br>
 Victorin gazed sadly at his father-in-law, wondering whether
folly and<br>
 vanity were not forces on a par with true greatness of soul.
The<br>
 causes that act on the springs of the soul seem to be quite<br>
 independent of the results. Can it be that the fortitude which
upholds<br>
 a great criminal is the same as that which a Champcenetz so
proudly<br>
 walks to the scaffold?</p>

<p>By the end of the week Madame Crevel was buried, after
dreadful<br>
 sufferings; and Crevel followed her within two days. Thus
the<br>
 marriage-contract was annulled. Crevel was heir to Valerie.</p>

<p>On the very day after the funeral, the friar called again on
the<br>
 lawyer, who received him in perfect silence. The monk held out
his<br>
 hand without a word, and without a word Victorin Hulot gave him
eighty<br>
 thousand-franc notes, taken from a sum of money found in
Crevel's<br>
 desk.</p>

<p>Young Madame Hulot inherited the estate of Presles and thirty
thousand<br>
 francs a year.</p>

<p>Madame Crevel had bequeathed a sum of three hundred thousand
francs to<br>
 Baron Hulot. Her scrofulous boy Stanislas was to inherit, at
his<br>
 majority, the Hotel Crevel and eighty thousand francs a
year.</p>

<p>Among the many noble associations founded in Paris by
Catholic<br>
 charity, there is one, originated by Madame de la Chanterie,
for<br>
 promoting civil and religious marriages between persons who
have<br>
 formed a voluntary but illicit union. Legislators, who draw
large<br>
 revenues from the registration fees, and the Bourgeois dynasty,
which<br>
 benefits by the notary's profits, affect to overlook the fact
that<br>
 three-fourths of the poorer class cannot afford fifteen francs
for the<br>
 marriage-contract. The pleaders, a sufficiently vilified
body,<br>
 gratuitously defend the cases of the indigent, while the
notaries have<br>
 not as yet agreed to charge nothing for the marriage-contract of
the<br>
 poor. As to the revenue collectors, the whole machinery of
Government<br>
 would have to be dislocated to induce the authorities to relax
their<br>
 demands. The registrar's office is deaf and dumb.</p>

<p>Then the Church, too, receives a duty on marriages. In France
the<br>
 Church depends largely on such revenues; even in the House of
God it<br>
 traffics in chairs and kneeling stools in a way that offends<br>
 foreigners; though it cannot have forgotten the anger of the
Saviour<br>
 who drove the money-changers out of the Temple. If the Church is
so<br>
 loath to relinquish its dues, it must be supposed that these
dues,<br>
 known as Vestry dues, are one of its sources of maintenance, and
then<br>
 the fault of the Church is the fault of the State.</p>

<p>The co-operation of these conditions, at a time when charity
is too<br>
 greatly concerned with the negroes and the petty offenders
discharged<br>
 from prison to trouble itself about honest folks in
difficulties,<br>
 results in the existence of a number of decent couples who have
never<br>
 been legally married for lack of thirty francs, the lowest
figure for<br>
 which the Notary, the Registrar, the Mayor and the Church will
unite<br>
 two citizens of Paris. Madame de la Chanterie's fund, founded
to<br>
 restore poor households to their religious and legal status,
hunts up<br>
 such couples, and with all the more success because it helps
them in<br>
 their poverty before attacking their unlawful union.</p>

<p>As soon as Madame Hulot had recovered, she returned to her<br>
 occupations. And then it was that the admirable Madame de la
Chanterie<br>
 came to beg that Adeline would add the legalization of these
voluntary<br>
 unions to the other good works of which she was the
instrument.</p>

<p>One of the Baroness' first efforts in this cause was made in
the<br>
 ominous-looking district, formerly known as la Petite
Pologne--Little<br>
 Poland--bounded by the Rue du Rocher, Rue de la Pepiniere, and
Rue de<br>
 Miromenil. There exists there a sort of offshoot of the
Faubourg<br>
 Saint-Marceau. To give an idea of this part of the town, it is
enough<br>
 to say that the landlords of some of the houses tenanted by
working<br>
 men without work, by dangerous characters, and by the very
poor<br>
 employed in unhealthy toil, dare not demand their rents, and can
find<br>
 no bailiffs bold enough to evict insolvent lodgers. At the
present<br>
 time speculating builders, who are fast changing the aspect of
this<br>
 corner of Paris, and covering the waste ground lying between the
Rue<br>
 d'Amsterdam and the Rue Faubourg-du-Roule, will no doubt alter
the<br>
 character of the inhabitants; for the trowel is a more
civilizing<br>
 agent than is generally supposed. By erecting substantial and
handsome<br>
 houses, with porters at the doors, by bordering the streets
with<br>
 footwalks and shops, speculation, while raising the rents,
disperses<br>
 the squalid class, families bereft of furniture, and lodgers
that<br>
 cannot pay. And so these districts are cleared of such
objectionable<br>
 residents, and the dens vanish into which the police never
venture but<br>
 under the sanction of the law.</p>

<p>In June 1844, the purlieus of the Place de Laborde were still
far from<br>
 inviting. The genteel pedestrian, who by chance should turn out
of the<br>
 Rue de la Pepiniere into one of those dreadful side-streets,
would<br>
 have been dismayed to see how vile a bohemia dwelt cheek by jowl
with<br>
 the aristocracy. In such places as these, haunted by ignorant
poverty<br>
 and misery driven to bay, flourish the last public
letter-writers who<br>
 are to be found in Paris. Wherever you see the two words
"Ecrivain<br>
 Public" written in a fine copy hand on a sheet of letter-paper
stuck<br>
 to the window pane of some low entresol or mud-splashed
ground-floor<br>
 room, you may safely conclude that the neighborhood is the
lurking<br>
 place of many unlettered folks, and of much vice and crime,
the<br>
 outcome of misery; for ignorance is the mother of all sorts of
crime.<br>
 A crime is, in the first instance, a defect of reasoning
powers.</p>

<p>While the Baroness had been ill, this quarter, to which she
was a<br>
 minor Providence, had seen the advent of a public writer who
settled<br>
 in the Passage du Soleil--Sun Alley--a spot of which the name is
one<br>
 of the antitheses dear to the Parisian, for the passage is
especially<br>
 dark. This writer, supposed to be a German, was named Vyder, and
he<br>
 lived on matrimonial terms with a young creature of whom he was
so<br>
 jealous that he never allowed her to go anywhere excepting to
some<br>
 honest stove and flue-fitters, in the Rue Saint-Lazare,
Italians, as<br>
 such fitters always are, but long since established in Paris.
These<br>
 people had been saved from a bankruptcy, which would have
reduced them<br>
 to misery, by the Baroness, acting in behalf of Madame de la<br>
 Chanterie. In a few months comfort had taken the place of
poverty, and<br>
 Religion had found a home in hearts which once had cursed Heaven
with<br>
 the energy peculiar to Italian stove-fitters. So one of Madame
Hulot's<br>
 first visits was to this family.</p>

<p>She was pleased at the scene that presented itself to her eyes
at the<br>
 back of the house where these worthy folks lived in the Rue
Saint-<br>
 Lazare, not far from the Rue du Rocher. High above the stores
and<br>
 workshops, now well filled, where toiled a swarm of apprentices
and<br>
 workmen--all Italians from the valley of Domo d'Ossola--the
master's<br>
 family occupied a set of rooms, which hard work had blessed
with<br>
 abundance. The Baroness was hailed like the Virgin Mary in
person.</p>

<p>After a quarter of an hour's questioning, Adeline, having to
wait for<br>
 the father to inquire how his business was prospering, pursued
her<br>
 saintly calling as a spy by asking whether they knew of any
families<br>
 needing help.</p>

<p>"Ah, dear lady, you who could save the damned from hell!" said
the<br>
 Italian wife, "there is a girl quite near here to be saved
from<br>
 perdition."</p>

<p>"A girl well known to you?" asked the Baroness.</p>

<p>"She is the granddaughter of a master my husband formerly
worked for,<br>
 who came to France in 1798, after the Revolution, by name
Judici. Old<br>
 Judici, in Napoleon's time, was one of the principal
stove-fitters in<br>
 Paris; he died in 1819, leaving his son a fine fortune. But
the<br>
 younger Judici wasted all his money on bad women; till, at last,
he<br>
 married one who was sharper than the rest, and she had this
poor<br>
 little girl, who is just turned fifteen."</p>

<p>"And what is wrong with her?" asked Adeline, struck by the
resemblance<br>
 between this Judici and her husband.</p>

<p>"Well, madame, this child, named Atala, ran away from her
father, and<br>
 came to live close by here with an old German of eighty at
least,<br>
 named Vyder, who does odd jobs for people who cannot read and
write.<br>
 Now, if this old sinner, who bought the child of her mother,
they say<br>
 for fifteen hundred francs, would but marry her, as he certainly
has<br>
 not long to live, and as he is said to have some few thousand
of<br>
 francs a year--well, the poor thing, who is a sweet little
angel,<br>
 would be out of mischief, and above want, which must be the ruin
of<br>
 her."</p>

<p>"Thank you very much for the information. I may do some good,
but I<br>
 must act with caution.--Who is the old man?"</p>

<p>"Oh! madame, he is a good old fellow; he makes the child very
happy,<br>
 and he has some sense too, for he left the part of town where
the<br>
 Judicis live, as I believe, to snatch the child from her
mother's<br>
 clutches. The mother was jealous of her, and I dare say she
thought<br>
 she could make money out of her beauty and make a
<i>mademoiselle</i> of<br>
 the girl.</p>

<p>"Atala remembered us, and advised her gentleman to settle near
us; and<br>
 as the good man sees how decent we are, he allows her to come
here.<br>
 But get them married, madame, and you will do an action worthy
of you.<br>
 Once married, the child will be independent and free from her
mother,<br>
 who keeps an eye on her, and who, if she could make money by
her,<br>
 would like to see her on the stage, or successful in the wicked
life<br>
 she meant her to lead."</p>

<p>"Why doesn't the old man marry her?"</p>

<p>"There was no necessity for it, you see," said the Italian.
"And<br>
 though old Vyder is not a bad old fellow, I fancy he is sharp
enough<br>
 to wish to remain the master, while if he once got married--why,
the<br>
 poor man is afraid of the stone that hangs round every old
man's<br>
 neck."</p>

<p>"Could you send for the girl to come here?" said Madame Hulot.
"I<br>
 should see her quietly, and find out what could be done--"</p>

<p>The stove-fitter's wife signed to her eldest girl, who ran
off. Ten<br>
 minutes later she returned, leading by the hand a child of
fifteen and<br>
 a half, a beauty of the Italian type. Mademoiselle Judici
inherited<br>
 from her father that ivory skin which, rather yellow by day, is
by<br>
 artificial light of lily-whiteness; eyes of Oriental beauty,
form, and<br>
 brilliancy, close curling lashes like black feathers, hair of
ebony<br>
 hue, and that native dignity of the Lombard race which makes
the<br>
 foreigner, as he walks through Milan on a Sunday, fancy that
every<br>
 porter's daughter is a princess.</p>

<p>Atala, told by the stove-fitter's daughter that she was to
meet the<br>
 great lady of whom she had heard so much, had hastily dressed in
a<br>
 black silk gown, a smart little cape, and neat boots. A cap with
a<br>
 cherry-colored bow added to the brilliant effect of her
coloring. The<br>
 child stood in an attitude of artless curiosity, studying the
Baroness<br>
 out of the corner of her eye, for her palsied trembling puzzled
her<br>
 greatly.</p>

<p>Adeline sighed deeply as she saw this jewel of womanhood in
the mire<br>
 of prostitution, and determined to rescue her to virtue.</p>

<p>"What is your name, my dear?"</p>

<p>"Atala, madame."</p>

<p>"And can you read and write?"</p>

<p>"No, madame; but that does not matter, as monsieur can."</p>

<p>"Did your parents ever take you to church? Have you been to
your first<br>
 Communion? Do you know your Catechism?"</p>

<p>"Madame, papa wanted to make me do something of the kind you
speak of,<br>
 but mamma would not have it--"</p>

<p>"Your mother?" exclaimed the Baroness. "Is she bad to you,
then?"</p>

<p>"She was always beating me. I don't know why, but I was always
being<br>
 quarreled over by my father and mother--"</p>

<p>"Did you ever hear of God?" cried the Baroness.</p>

<p>The girl looked up wide-eyed.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, papa and mamma often said 'Good God,' and 'In God's
name,'<br>
 and 'God's thunder,' " said she, with perfect simplicity.</p>

<p>"Then you never saw a church? Did you never think of going
into one?"</p>

<p>"A church?--Notre-Dame, the Pantheon?--I have seen them from
a<br>
 distance, when papa took me into town; but that was not very
often.<br>
 There are no churches like those in the Faubourg."</p>

<p>"Which Faubourg did you live in?"</p>

<p>"In the Faubourg."</p>

<p>"Yes, but which?"</p>

<p>"In the Rue de Charonne, madame."</p>

<p>The inhabitants of the Faubourg Saint-Antoine never call
that<br>
 notorious district other than <i>the</i> Faubourg. To them it is
the one<br>
 and only Faubourg; and manufacturers generally understand the
words as<br>
 meaning the Faubourg Saint-Antoine.</p>

<p>"Did no one ever tell you what was right or wrong?"</p>

<p>"Mamma used to beat me when I did not do what pleased
her."</p>

<p>"But did you not know that it was very wicked to run away from
your<br>
 father and mother to go to live with an old man?"</p>

<p>Atala Judici gazed at the Baroness with a haughty stare, but
made no<br>
 reply.</p>

<p>"She is a perfect little savage," murmured Adeline.</p>

<p>"There are a great many like her in the Faubourg, madame,"
said the<br>
 stove-fitter's wife.</p>

<p>"But she knows nothing--not even what is wrong. Good
Heavens!--Why do<br>
 you not answer me?" said Madame Hulot, putting out her hand to
take<br>
 Atala's.</p>

<p>Atala indignantly withdrew a step.</p>

<p>"You are an old fool!" said she. "Why, my father and mother
had had<br>
 nothing to eat for a week. My mother wanted me to do much worse
than<br>
 that, I think, for my father thrashed her and called her a
thief!<br>
 However, Monsieur Vyder paid all their debts, and gave them some
money<br>
 --oh, a bagful! And he brought me away, and poor papa was
crying. But<br>
 we had to part!--Was it wicked?" she asked.</p>

<p>"And are you very fond of Monsieur Vyder?"</p>

<p>"Fond of him?" said she. "I should think so! He tells me
beautiful<br>
 stories, madame, every evening; and he has given me nice gowns,
and<br>
 linen, and a shawl. Why, I am figged out like a princess, and I
never<br>
 wear sabots now. And then, I have not known what it is to be
hungry<br>
 these two months past. And I don't live on potatoes now. He
brings me<br>
 bonbons and burnt almonds, and chocolate almonds.--Aren't they
good?--<br>
 I do anything he pleases for a bag of chocolate.--Then my old
Daddy is<br>
 very kind; he takes such care of me, and is so nice; I know now
what<br>
 my mother ought to have been.--He is going to get an old woman
to help<br>
 me, for he doesn't like me to dirty my hands with cooking. For
the<br>
 past month, too, he has been making a little money, and he gives
me<br>
 three francs every evening that I put into a money-box. Only he
will<br>
 never let me out except to come here--and he calls me his
little<br>
 kitten! Mamma never called me anything but bad names--and thief,
and<br>
 vermin!"</p>

<p><br>
 "Well, then, my child, why should not Daddy Vyder be your
husband?"</p>

<p>"But he is, madame," said the girl, looking at Adeline with
calm<br>
 pride, without a blush, her brow smooth, her eyes steady. "He
told me<br>
 that I was his little wife; but it is a horrid bore to be a
man's wife<br>
 --if it were not for the burnt almonds!"</p>

<p>"Good Heaven!" said the Baroness to herself, "what monster can
have<br>
 had the heart to betray such perfect, such holy innocence? To
restore<br>
 this child to the ways of virtue would surely atone for many
sins.--I<br>
 knew what I was doing." thought she, remembering the scene
with<br>
 Crevel. "But she--she knows nothing."</p>

<p>"Do you know Monsieur Samanon?" asked Atala, with an
insinuating look.</p>

<p>"No, my child; but why do you ask?"</p>

<p>"Really and truly?" said the artless girl.</p>

<p>"You have nothing to fear from this lady," said the Italian
woman.<br>
 "She is an angel."</p>

<p>"It is because my good old boy is afraid of being caught by
Samanon.<br>
 He is hiding, and I wish he could be free--"</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"On! then he would take me to Bobino, perhaps to the
Ambigu."</p>

<p>"What a delightful creature!" said the Baroness, kissing the
girl.</p>

<p>"Are you rich?" asked Atala, who was fingering the Baroness'
lace<br>
 ruffles.</p>

<p>"Yes, and No," replied Madame Hulot. "I am rich for dear
little girls<br>
 like you when they are willing to be taught their duties as
Christians<br>
 by a priest, and to walk in the right way."</p>

<p>"What way is that?" said Atala; "I walk on my two feet."</p>

<p>"The way of virtue."</p>

<p>Atala looked at the Baroness with a crafty smile.</p>

<p>"Look at madame," said the Baroness, pointing to the
stove-fitter's<br>
 wife, "she has been quite happy because she was received into
the<br>
 bosom of the Church. You married like the beasts that
perish."</p>

<p>"I?" said Atala. "Why, if you will give me as much as Daddy
Vyder<br>
 gives me, I shall be quite happy unmarried again. It is a
grind.--Do<br>
 you know what it is to--?"</p>

<p>"But when once you are united to a man as you are," the
Baroness put<br>
 in, "virtue requires you to remain faithful to him."</p>

<p>"Till he dies," said Atala, with a knowing flash. "I shall not
have to<br>
 wait long. If you only knew how Daddy Vyder coughs and
blows.--Poof,<br>
 poof," and she imitated the old man.</p>

<p>"Virtue and morality require that the Church, representing
God, and<br>
 the Mayor, representing the law, should consecrate your
marriage,"<br>
 Madame Hulot went on. "Look at madame; she is legally
married--"</p>

<p>"Will it make it more amusing?" asked the girl.</p>

<p>"You will be happier," said the Baroness, "for no one could
then blame<br>
 you. You would satisfy God! Ask her if she was married without
the<br>
 sacrament of marriage!"</p>

<p>Atala looked at the Italian.</p>

<p>"How is she any better than I am?" she asked. "I am prettier
than she<br>
 is."</p>

<p>"Yes, but I am an honest woman," said the wife, "and you may
be called<br>
 by a bad name."</p>

<p>"How can you expect God to protect you if you trample every
law, human<br>
 and divine, under foot?" said the Baroness. "Don't you know that
God<br>
 has Paradise in store for those who obey the injunctions of
His<br>
 Church?"</p>

<p>"What is there in Paradise? Are there playhouses?"</p>

<p>"Paradise!" said Adeline, "is every joy you can conceive of.
It is<br>
 full of angels with white wings. You see God in all His glory,
you<br>
 share His power, you are happy for every minute of
eternity!"</p>

<p>Atala listened to the lady as she might have listened to
music; but<br>
 Adeline, seeing that she was incapable of understanding her,
thought<br>
 she had better take another line of action and speak to the old
man.</p>

<p>"Go home, then, my child, and I will go to see Monsieur Vyder.
Is he a<br>
 Frenchman?"</p>

<p>"He is an Alsatian, madame. But he will be quite rich soon. If
you<br>
 would pay what he owes to that vile Samanon, he would give you
back<br>
 your money, for in a few months he will be getting six thousand
francs<br>
 a year, he says, and we are to go to live in the country a long
way<br>
 off, in the Vosges."</p>

<p>At the word <i>Vosges</i> the Baroness sat lost in reverie. It
called up<br>
 the vision of her native village. She was roused from her
melancholy<br>
 meditation by the entrance of the stove-fitter, who came to
assure her<br>
 of his prosperity.</p>

<p>"In a year's time, madame, I can repay the money you lent us,
for it<br>
 is God's money, the money of the poor and wretched. If ever I
make a<br>
 fortune, come to me for what you want, and I will render through
you<br>
 the help to others which you first brought us."</p>

<p>"Just now," said Madame Hulot, "I do not need your money, but
I ask<br>
 your assistance in a good work. I have just seen that little
Judici,<br>
 who is living with an old man, and I mean to see them regularly
and<br>
 legally married."</p>

<p>"Ah! old Vyder; he is a very worthy old fellow, with plenty of
good<br>
 sense. The poor old man has already made friends in the
neighborhood,<br>
 though he has been here but two months. He keeps my accounts for
me.<br>
 He is, I believe, a brave Colonel who served the Emperor well.
And how<br>
 he adores Napoleon!--He has some orders, but he never wears
them. He<br>
 is waiting till he is straight again, for he is in debt, poor
old boy!<br>
 In fact, I believe he is hiding, threatened by the law--"</p>

<p>"Tell him that I will pay his debts if he will marry the
child."</p>

<p>"Oh, that will soon be settled.--Suppose you were to see him,
madame;<br>
 it is not two steps away, in the Passage du Soleil."</p>

<p>So the lady and the stove-fitter went out.</p>

<p>"This way, madame," said the man, turning down the Rue de
la<br>
 Pepiniere.</p>

<p>The alley runs, in fact, from the bottom of this street
through to the<br>
 Rue du Rocher. Halfway down this passage, recently opened
through,<br>
 where the shops let at a very low rent, the Baroness saw on a
window,<br>
 screened up to a height with a green, gauze curtain, which
excluded<br>
 the prying eyes of the passer-by, the words:</p>

<p><br>
 "ECRIVAIN PUBLIC";</p>

<p>and on the door the announcement:</p>

<p>BUSINESS TRANSACTED.</p>

<p><i>Petitions Drawn Up, Accounts Audited, Etc.</i></p>

<p><i>With Secrecy and Dispatch.</i></p>

<p><br>
 The shop was like one of those little offices where travelers
by<br>
 omnibus wait the vehicles to take them on to their destination.
A<br>
 private staircase led up, no doubt, to the living-rooms on
the<br>
 entresol which were let with the shop. Madame Hulot saw a
dirty<br>
 writing-table of some light wood, some letter-boxes, and a
wretched<br>
 second-hand chair. A cap with a peak and a greasy green shade
for the<br>
 eyes suggested either precautions for disguise, or weak eyes,
which<br>
 was not unlikely in an old man.</p>

<p>"He is upstairs," said the stove-fitter. "I will go up and
tell him to<br>
 come down."</p>

<p>Adeline lowered her veil and took a seat. A heavy step made
the narrow<br>
 stairs creak, and Adeline could not restrain a piercing cry when
she<br>
 saw her husband, Baron Hulot, in a gray knitted jersey, old
gray<br>
 flannel trousers, and slippers.</p>

<p>"What is your business, madame?" said Hulot, with a
flourish.</p>

<p>She rose, seized Hulot by the arm, and said in a voice hoarse
with<br>
 emotion:</p>

<p>"At last--I have found you!"</p>

<p>"Adeline!" exclaimed the Baron in bewilderment, and he locked
the shop<br>
 door. "Joseph, go out the back way," he added to the
stove-fitter.</p>

<p>"My dear!" she said, forgetting everything in her excessive
joy, "you<br>
 can come home to us all; we are rich. Your son draws a hundred
and<br>
 sixty thousand francs a year! Your pension is released; there
are<br>
 fifteen thousand francs of arrears you can get on showing that
you are<br>
 alive. Valerie is dead, and left you three hundred thousand
francs.</p>

<p>"Your name is quite forgotten by this time; you may reappear
in the<br>
 world, and you will find a fortune awaiting you at your son's
house.<br>
 Come; our happiness will be complete. For nearly three years I
have<br>
 been seeking you, and I felt so sure of finding you that a room
is<br>
 ready waiting for you. Oh! come away from this, come away from
the<br>
 dreadful state I see you in!"</p>

<p>"I am very willing," said the bewildered Baron, "but can I
take the<br>
 girl?"</p>

<p>"Hector, give her up! Do that much for your Adeline, who has
never<br>
 before asked you to make the smallest sacrifice. I promise you I
will<br>
 give the child a marriage portion; I will see that she marries
well,<br>
 and has some education. Let it be said of one of the women who
have<br>
 given you happiness that she too is happy; and do not relapse
into<br>
 vice, into the mire."</p>

<p>"So it was you," said the Baron, with a smile, "who wanted to
see me<br>
 married?--Wait a few minutes," he added; "I will go upstairs
and<br>
 dress; I have some decent clothes in a trunk."</p>

<p>Adeline, left alone, and looking round the squalid shop,
melted into<br>
 tears.</p>

<p>"He has been living here, and we rolling in wealth!" said she
to<br>
 herself. "Poor man, he has indeed been punished--he who was
elegance<br>
 itself."</p>

<p>The stove-fitter returned to make his bow to his benefactress,
and she<br>
 desired him to fetch a coach. When he came back, she begged him
to<br>
 give little Atala Judici a home, and to take her away at
once.</p>

<p>"And tell her that if she will place herself under the
guidance of<br>
 Monsieur the Cure of the Madeleine, on the day when she attends
her<br>
 first Communion I will give her thirty thousand francs and find
her a<br>
 good husband, some worthy young man."</p>

<p>"My eldest son, then madame! He is two-and-twenty, and he
worships the<br>
 child."</p>

<p>The Baron now came down; there were tears in his eyes.</p>

<p>"You are forcing me to desert the only creature who had ever
begun to<br>
 love me at all as you do!" said he in a whisper to his wife.
"She is<br>
 crying bitterly, and I cannot abandon her so--"</p>

<p>"Be quite easy, Hector. She will find a home with honest
people, and I<br>
 will answer for her conduct."</p>

<p>"Well, then, I can go with you," said the Baron, escorting his
wife to<br>
 the cab.</p>

<p>Hector, the Baron d'Ervy once more, had put on a blue coat
and<br>
 trousers, a white waistcoat, a black stock, and gloves. When
the<br>
 Baroness had taken her seat in the vehicle, Atala slipped in
like an<br>
 eel.</p>

<p>"Oh, madame," she said, "let me go with you. I will be so
good, so<br>
 obedient; I will do whatever you wish; but do not part me from
my<br>
 Daddy Vyder, my kind Daddy who gives me such nice things. I
shall be<br>
 beaten--"</p>

<p>"Come, come, Atala," said the Baron, "this lady is my wife--we
must<br>
 part--"</p>

<p>"She! As old as that! and shaking like a leaf!" said the
child. "Look<br>
 at her head!" and she laughingly mimicked the Baroness'
palsy.</p>

<p>The stove-fitter, who had run after the girl, came to the
carriage<br>
 door.</p>

<p>"Take her away!" said Adeline. The man put his arms round
Atala and<br>
 fairly carried her off.</p>

<p>"Thanks for such a sacrifice, my dearest," said Adeline,
taking the<br>
 Baron's hand and clutching it with delirious joy. "How much you
are<br>
 altered! you must have suffered so much! What a surprise for
Hortense<br>
 and for your son!"</p>

<p>Adeline talked as lovers talk who meet after a long absence,
of a<br>
 hundred things at once.</p>

<p>In ten minutes the Baron and his wife reached the Rue
Louis-le-Grand,<br>
 and there Adeline found this note awaiting her:--</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"MADAME LA BARONNE,--</p>

<p>"Monsieur le Baron Hulot d'Ervy lived for one month in the Rue
de<br>
 Charonne under the name of Thorec, an anagram of Hector. He is
now<br>
 in the Passage du Soleil by the name of Vyder. He says he is
an<br>
 Alsatian, and does writing, and he lives with a girl named
Atala<br>
 Judici. Be very cautious, madame, for search is on foot; the
Baron<br>
 is wanted, on what score I know not.</p>

<p>"The actress has kept her word, and remains, as ever,</p>

<p>"Madame la Baronne, your humble servant,<br>
 "J. M."</p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
 The Baron's return was hailed with such joy as reconciled him
to<br>
 domestic life. He forgot little Atala Judici, for excesses
of<br>
 profligacy had reduced him to the volatility of feeling that
is<br>
 characteristic of childhood. But the happiness of the family
was<br>
 dashed by the change that had come over him. He had been still
hale<br>
 when he had gone away from his home; he had come back almost
a<br>
 hundred, broken, bent, and his expression even debased.</p>

<p><br>
 A splendid dinner, improvised by Celestine, reminded the old man
of<br>
 the singer's banquets; he was dazzled by the splendor of his
home.</p>

<p>"A feast in honor of the return of the prodigal father?" said
he in a<br>
 murmur to Adeline.</p>

<p>"Hush!" said she, "all is forgotten."</p>

<p>"And Lisbeth?" he asked, not seeing the old maid.</p>

<p>"I am sorry to say that she is in bed," replied Hortense. "She
can<br>
 never get up, and we shall have the grief of losing her ere
long. She<br>
 hopes to see you after dinner."</p>

<p>At daybreak next morning Victorin Hulot was informed by the
porter's<br>
 wife that soldiers of the municipal guard were posted all round
the<br>
 premises; the police demanded Baron Hulot. The bailiff, who
had<br>
 followed the woman, laid a summons in due form before the
lawyer, and<br>
 asked him whether he meant to pay his father's debts. The claim
was<br>
 for ten thousand francs at the suit of an usurer named Samanon,
who<br>
 had probably lent the Baron two or three thousand at most.
Victorin<br>
 desired the bailiff to dismiss his men, and paid.</p>

<p>"But is it the last?" he anxiously wondered.</p>

<p>Lisbeth, miserable already at seeing the family so prosperous,
could<br>
 not survive this happy event. She grew so rapidly worse that
Bianchon<br>
 gave her but a week to live, conquered at last in the long
struggle in<br>
 which she had scored so many victories.</p>

<p>She kept the secret of her hatred even through a painful death
from<br>
 pulmonary consumption. And, indeed, she had the supreme
satisfaction<br>
 of seeing Adeline, Hortense, Hulot, Victorin, Steinbock,
Celestine,<br>
 and their children standing in tears round her bed and mourning
for<br>
 her as the angel of the family.</p>

<p>Baron Hulot, enjoying a course of solid food such as he had
not known<br>
 for nearly three years, recovered flesh and strength, and was
almost<br>
 himself again. This improvement was such a joy to Adeline that
her<br>
 nervous trembling perceptibly diminished.</p>

<p>"She will be happy after all," said Lisbeth to herself on the
day<br>
 before she died, as she saw the veneration with which the
Baron<br>
 regarded his wife, of whose sufferings he had heard from
Hortense and<br>
 Victorin.</p>

<p>And vindictiveness hastened Cousin Betty's end. The family
followed<br>
 her, weeping, to the grave.</p>

<p>The Baron and Baroness, having reached the age which looks for
perfect<br>
 rest, gave up the handsome rooms on the first floor to the Count
and<br>
 Countess Steinbock, and took those above. The Baron by his
son's<br>
 exertions found an official position in the management of a
railroad,<br>
 in 1845, with a salary of six thousand francs, which, added to
the six<br>
 thousand of his pension and the money left to him by Madame
Crevel,<br>
 secured him an income of twenty-four thousand francs. Hortense
having<br>
 enjoyed her independent income during the three years of
separation<br>
 from Wenceslas, Victorin now invested the two hundred thousand
francs<br>
 he had in trust, in his sister's name and he allowed her
twelve<br>
 thousand francs.</p>

<p>Wenceslas, as the husband of a rich woman, was not unfaithful,
but he<br>
 was an idler; he could not make up his mind to begin any work,
however<br>
 trifling. Once more he became the artist <i>in partibus</i>; he
was popular<br>
 in society, and consulted by amateurs; in short, he became a
critic,<br>
 like all the feeble folk who fall below their promise.</p>

<p>Thus each household, though living as one family, had its own
fortune.<br>
 The Baroness, taught by bitter experience, left the management
of<br>
 matters to her son, and the Baron was thus reduced to his
salary, in<br>
 hope that the smallness of his income would prevent his
relapsing into<br>
 mischief. And by some singular good fortune, on which neither
the<br>
 mother nor the son had reckoned, Hulot seemed to have foresworn
the<br>
 fair sex. His subdued behaviour, ascribed to the course of
nature, so<br>
 completely reassured the family, that they enjoyed to the full
his<br>
 recovered amiability and delightful qualities. He was
unfailingly<br>
 attentive to his wife and children, escorted them to the
play,<br>
 reappeared in society, and did the honors to his son's house
with<br>
 exquisite grace. In short, this reclaimed prodigal was the joy
of his<br>
 family.</p>

<p>He was a most agreeable old man, a ruin, but full of wit,
having<br>
 retained no more of his vice than made it an added social
grace.</p>

<p>Of course, everybody was quite satisfied and easy. The young
people<br>
 and the Baroness lauded the model father to the skies,
forgetting the<br>
 death of the two uncles. Life cannot go on without much
forgetting!</p>

<p>Madame Victorin, who managed this enormous household with
great skill,<br>
 due, no doubt, to Lisbeth's training, had found it necessary to
have a<br>
 man-cook. This again necessitated a kitchen-maid. Kitchen-maids
are in<br>
 these days ambitious creatures, eager to detect the
<i>chef's</i> secrets,<br>
 and to become cooks as soon as they have learnt to stir a
sauce.<br>
 Consequently, the kitchen-maid is liable to frequent change.</p>

<p>At the beginning of 1845 Celestine engaged as kitchen-maid a
sturdy<br>
 Normandy peasant come from Isigny--short-waisted, with strong
red<br>
 arms, a common face, as dull as an "occasional piece" at the
play, and<br>
 hardly to be persuaded out of wearing the classical linen cap
peculiar<br>
 to the women of Lower Normandy. This girl, as buxom as a
wet-nurse,<br>
 looked as if she would burst the blue cotton check in which
she<br>
 clothed her person. Her florid face might have been hewn out of
stone,<br>
 so hard were its tawny outlines.</p>

<p>Of course no attention was paid to the advent in the house of
this<br>
 girl, whose name was Agathe--an ordinary, wide-awake specimen,
such as<br>
 is daily imported from the provinces. Agathe had no attractions
for<br>
 the cook, her tongue was too rough, for she had served in a
suburban<br>
 inn, waiting on carters; and instead of making a conquest of her
chief<br>
 and winning from him the secrets of the high art of the kitchen,
she<br>
 was the object of his great contempt. The <i>chef's</i>
attentions were, in<br>
 fact, devoted to Louise, the Countess Steinbock's maid. The
country<br>
 girl, thinking herself ill-used, complained bitterly that she
was<br>
 always sent out of the way on some pretext when the <i>chef</i>
was<br>
 finishing a dish or putting the crowning touch to a sauce.</p>

<p>"I am out of luck," said she, "and I shall go to another
place."</p>

<p>And yet she stayed though she had twice given notice to
quit.</p>

<p>One night, Adeline, roused by some unusual noise, did not see
Hector<br>
 in the bed he occupied near hers; for they slept side by side in
two<br>
 beds, as beseemed an old couple. She lay awake an hour, but he
did not<br>
 return. Seized with a panic, fancying some tragic end had
overtaken<br>
 him--an apoplectic attack, perhaps--she went upstairs to the
floor<br>
 occupied by the servants, and then was attracted to the room
where<br>
 Agathe slept, partly by seeing a light below the door, and
partly by<br>
 the murmur of voices. She stood still in dismay on recognizing
the<br>
 voice of her husband, who, a victim to Agathe's charms, to
vanquish<br>
 this strapping wench's not disinterested resistance, went to
the<br>
 length of saying:</p>

<p>"My wife has not long to live, and if you like you may be a
Baroness."</p>

<p>Adeline gave a cry, dropped her candlestick, and fled.</p>

<p>Three days later the Baroness, who had received the last
sacraments,<br>
 was dying, surrounded by her weeping family.</p>

<p>Just before she died, she took her husband's hand and pressed
it,<br>
 murmuring in his ear:</p>

<p>"My dear, I had nothing left to give up to you but my life. In
a<br>
 minute or two you will be free, and can make another Baronne
Hulot."</p>

<p>And, rare sight, tears oozed from her dead eyes.</p>

<p>This desperateness of vice had vanquished the patience of the
angel,<br>
 who, on the brink of eternity, gave utterance to the only
reproach she<br>
 had ever spoken in her life.</p>

<p>The Baron left Paris three days after his wife's funeral.
Eleven<br>
 months after Victorin heard indirectly of his father's marriage
to<br>
 Mademoiselle Agathe Piquetard, solemnized at Isigny, on the
1st<br>
 February 1846.</p>

<p>"Parents may hinder their children's marriage, but children
cannot<br>
 interfere with the insane acts of their parents in their
second<br>
 childhood," said Maitre Hulot to Maitre Popinot, the second son
of the<br>
 Minister of Commerce, who was discussing this marriage.</p>

Most people start at our Web sites at:
http://gutenberg.net or
http://promo.net/pg

These Web sites include award-winning information about Project
Gutenberg, including how to donate, how to help produce our new
eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter (free!).


Those of you who want to download any eBook before announcement
can get to them as follows, and just download by date.  This is
also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the
indexes our cataloguers produce obviously take a while after an
announcement goes out in the Project Gutenberg Newsletter.

http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext03 or
ftp://ftp.ibiblio.org/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext03

Or /etext02, 01, 00, 99, 98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90

Just search by the first five letters of the filename you want,
as it appears in our Newsletters.


Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text
files per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.

ways.

Why is this "Small Print!" statement here? You know: lawyers.
They tell us you might sue us if there is something wrong with
your copy of this eBook, even if you got it for free from
someone other than us, and even if what's wrong is not our
fault. So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement
disclaims most of our liability to you. It also tells you how
you may distribute copies of this eBook if you want to.

*BEFORE!* YOU USE OR READ THIS EBOOK
By using or reading any part of this PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
eBook, you indicate that you understand, agree to and accept
this "Small Print!" statement. If you do not, you can receive
a refund of the money (if any) you paid for this eBook by
sending a request within 30 days of receiving it to the person
you got it from. If you received this eBook on a physical
medium (such as a disk), you must return it with your request.

ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM EBOOKS
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBook, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBooks,
is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor Michael S. Hart
through the Project Gutenberg Association (the "Project").
Among other things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and
distribute it in the United States without permission and
without paying copyright royalties. Special rules, set forth
below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this eBook
under the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.

Please do not use the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark to market
any commercial products without permission.

To create these eBooks, the Project expends considerable
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain
works. Despite these efforts, the Project's eBooks and any
medium they may be on may contain "Defects". Among other
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged
disk or other eBook medium, a computer virus, or computer
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.

LIMITED WARRANTY; DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES
But for the "Right of Replacement or Refund" described below,
[1] Michael Hart and the Foundation (and any other party you may
receive this eBook from as a PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBook) disclaims
all liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including
legal fees, and [2] YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE OR
UNDER STRICT LIABILITY, OR FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY OR CONTRACT,
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE
OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

If you discover a Defect in this eBook within 90 days of
receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any)
you paid for it by sending an explanatory note within that
time to the person you received it from. If you received it
on a physical medium, you must return it with your note, and
such person may choose to alternatively give you a replacement
copy. If you received it electronically, such person may
choose to alternatively give you a second opportunity to
receive it electronically.

THIS EBOOK IS OTHERWISE PROVIDED TO YOU "AS-IS". NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ARE MADE TO YOU AS
TO THE EBOOK OR ANY MEDIUM IT MAY BE ON, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Some states do not allow disclaimers of implied warranties or
the exclusion or limitation of consequential damages, so the
above disclaimers and exclusions may not apply to you, and you
may have other legal rights.

INDEMNITY
You will indemnify and hold Michael Hart, the Foundation,
