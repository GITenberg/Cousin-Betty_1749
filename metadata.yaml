description: "La Cousine Bette (French pronunciation: ​[la kuzin bɛt], Cousin Bette)\
  \ is an 1846 novel by French author Honoré de Balzac. Set in mid-19th century Paris,\
  \ it tells the story of an unmarried middle-aged woman who plots the destruction\
  \ of her extended family. Bette works with Valérie Marneffe, an unhappily married\
  \ young lady, to seduce and torment a series of men. One of these is Baron Hector\
  \ Hulot, husband to Bette's cousin Adeline. He sacrifices his family's fortune and\
  \ good name to please Valérie, who leaves him for a tradesman named Crevel. The\
  \ book is part of the Scènes de la vie parisienne section of Balzac's novel sequence\
  \ La Comédie humaine (\"The Human Comedy\").\nIn the 1840s, a serial format known\
  \ as the roman-feuilleton was highly popular in France, and the most acclaimed expression\
  \ of it was the socialist writing of Eugène Sue. Balzac wanted to challenge Sue's\
  \ supremacy, and prove himself the most capable feuilleton author in France. Writing\
  \ quickly and with intense focus, Balzac produced La Cousine Bette, one of his longest\
  \ novels, in two months. It was published in Le Constitutionnel at the end of 1846,\
  \ then collected with a companion work, Le Cousin Pons, the following year.\nThe\
  \ novel's characters represent polarities of contrasting morality. The vengeful\
  \ Bette and disingenuous Valérie stand on one side, with the merciful Adeline and\
  \ her patient daughter Hortense on the other. The patriarch of the Hulot family,\
  \ meanwhile, is consumed by his own sexual desire. Hortense's husband, the Polish\
  \ exile Wenceslas Steinbock, represents artistic genius, though he succumbs to uncertainty\
  \ and lack of motivation. Balzac based the character of Bette in part on his mother\
  \ and the poet Marceline Desbordes-Valmore. At least one scene involving Baron Hulot\
  \ was likely based on an event in the life of Balzac's friend, the novelist Victor\
  \ Hugo.\nLa Cousine Bette is considered Balzac's last great work. His trademark\
  \ use of realist detail combines with a panorama of characters returning from earlier\
  \ novels. Several critics have hailed it as a turning point in the author's career,\
  \ and others have called it a prototypical naturalist text. It has been compared\
  \ to William Shakespeare's Othello as well as Leo Tolstoy's War and Peace. The novel\
  \ explores themes of vice and virtue, as well as the influence of money on French\
  \ society. Bette's relationship with Valérie is also seen as an important exploration\
  \ of homoerotic themes. A number of film versions of the story have been produced,\
  \ including a 1971 BBC mini-series starring Margaret Tyzack and Helen Mirren, and\
  \ a 1998 feature film with Jessica Lange in the title role.\n From Wikipedia (CC\
